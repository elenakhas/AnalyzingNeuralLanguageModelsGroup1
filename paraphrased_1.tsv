on the spur of the moment	It helps if you have your own truck/van, a handtruck, and enough cash to make decisions on the spur of the moment	craigslist, or join the KLOV.com forums and post in the wanted section, then buy from a reputable seller in your area if possible.  No matter what, start local so you can inspect the machine in person before buying.  Also, you don't want to shell out an additional $300-$450 to freight ship a game from several states away and get a nasty surprise.  Save the shipping-games-from-elsewhere feat for later after you've gotten to know people in the video arcade game collecting community in your area and/or on the KLOV forums and you know who you are dealing with.When dealing with craigslist be prepared for flakes.  Also be prepared to act fast.  It helps if you have your own truck/van, a handtruck, and enough cash to make decisions on the spur of the moment.  craigslist sellers are, by and large, an unethical lot, and many will sell a game out from under you if you don't hustle.  Also, beware the impromtu craigslist auction after a dumbass seller lists his game without doing any research first and then tries to play one buyer off another.  Auctions are for eBay, and those pricks should go there if they want to bleed people via a bidding process.  If you list a game for sale at a specific price, be a man and keep your word.  If you're too dumb/lazy to research game prices first, then you deserve the wrath you will get from the collector community if you pull that shit.  Just my $.02.

by all means	that being said if you get some for free and wouldn't mind throwing them out and replacing them after a few months of use, or if you wouldn't mind hanging out in a hospital because your gear failed when you needed it not to; then by all means indulge the alternatives	"powshred is right: ""all-round use"" ski setups, specifically bindings, are always a compromise; so you have to prioritize what type of skiing you intend to do most to determine the best equipment for YOU.allow me to break it down for you:MARKER bindings: by allowing complete boot compatibility, these are the weapon of choice for most AT skiers,  as you don't have to give up your tried-and-true alpine boots to rock 'em at the resort. and be honest with yourself, even the true backcountry shrednecks are still going to be spending a hefty chunk of their time on the lifts.-PROS: widely accessible, skies and adjusts like your alpine bindings, traditional DIN release settings,  will fit any boot, the DUKE will stand up to the abuse of the burliest of freeriders, the BARON is easy to find and relatively affordable, the F10/ F12 are lighter weight more futuristic looking versions of the former, geared slightly more toward spending more time out of bounds.-CONS: Heavy as all hell, made almost entirely out of plastic, the pivot point feels unnatural and clunky (attempted remedy in the F10/F12 redesign), the ski/tour locking mechanism is dumb; requires the skier to step out completely to engage/ disengage, and after an icy morning tour can be damn near impossible to get back into ski mode, and the heel climbing bar isn't adjustable, so it ends up feeling like it's always either too-high or too-lowFRITSCHI/ DIAMIR bindings: Like the markers, the big benefit here is these will adjust to accept dedicated AT boots as well as alpine style boots.

The problem with these is that they try too hard to do everything well, that they end up with a product that preforms equally poorly under all conditions.-PROS: easy to find, affordable, relatively light weight, adjustable and compatible with more different boot styles, DIN adjustable (a little different than alpine, but still essentially functional), no need to step-out to switch between ski and tour modes, and the locking interface is simple and relatively trouble-free (big pro!)-CONS: they ride ""tall"" and feel sloppy yielding a sensation of disconnectedness from the skis, they're frail and probably shouldn't be considered by anyone over 150lb, especially if you like to ride bumps, jumps, and/or drops.DYNAFIT binding systems: the holy grail of backcountry skiing equipment! BUT, notice how I headlined it as a binding ""system"", not just a binding? you need to use specially designed boots to be compatible with these bindings; if you choose to do so, however, you will be rewarded with the best skiing experience both up and down-hill, and contrary to the lamentations of internet rumor-mongers, these things PERFORM, under all conditions, unequivocally.

by all means	that being said if you get some for free and wouldn't mind throwing them out and replacing them after a few months of use, or if you wouldn't mind hanging out in a hospital because your gear failed when you needed it not to; then by all means indulge the alternatives	"powshred is right: ""all-round use"" ski setups, specifically bindings, are always a compromise; so you have to prioritize what type of skiing you intend to do most to determine the best equipment for YOU.allow me to break it down for you:MARKER bindings: by allowing complete boot compatibility, these are the weapon of choice for most AT skiers,  as you don't have to give up your tried-and-true alpine boots to rock 'em at the resort. and be honest with yourself, even the true backcountry shrednecks are still going to be spending a hefty chunk of their time on the lifts.-PROS: widely accessible, skies and adjusts like your alpine bindings, traditional DIN release settings,  will fit any boot, the DUKE will stand up to the abuse of the burliest of freeriders, the BARON is easy to find and relatively affordable, the F10/ F12 are lighter weight more futuristic looking versions of the former, geared slightly more toward spending more time out of bounds.-CONS: Heavy as all hell, made almost entirely out of plastic, the pivot point feels unnatural and clunky (attempted remedy in the F10/F12 redesign), the ski/tour locking mechanism is dumb; requires the skier to step out completely to engage/ disengage, and after an icy morning tour can be damn near impossible to get back into ski mode, and the heel climbing bar isn't adjustable, so it ends up feeling like it's always either too-high or too-lowFRITSCHI/ DIAMIR bindings: Like the markers, the big benefit here is these will adjust to accept dedicated AT boots as well as alpine style boots. Fritschi's are also considerably lighter-weight than the Markers, but don't be fooled by the fact that they offer a model called ""freeride"" these are for gentler use; I'm not a big guy (170lb), nor am I hard on my gear, but I've broken these things on several occasions. The problem with these is that they try too hard to do everything well, that they end up with a product that preforms equally poorly under all conditions.-PROS: easy to find, affordable, relatively light weight, adjustable and compatible with more different boot styles, DIN adjustable (a little different than alpine, but still essentially functional), no need to step-out to switch between ski and tour modes, and the locking interface is simple and relatively trouble-free (big pro!)-CONS: they ride ""tall"" and feel sloppy yielding a sensation of disconnectedness from the skis, they're frail and probably shouldn't be considered by anyone over 150lb, especially if you like to ride bumps, jumps, and/or drops.DYNAFIT binding systems: the holy grail of backcountry skiing equipment!

rule of thumb	The rule of thumb is that if there are 3x the number of players remaining than the number of players who get paid, you ignore the bubble	With your stack size at t1700 and the CPR (cost per round) at t600, you're sitting with a CSI of under 3. This means that if you don't make a move this orbit, you're going to run out of opportunities to do so very quickly. I don't know why BB was preparing to muck in a limped pot unless a) he's completely clueless or b) he's shooting an angle with a monster and trying to entice you into getting it in. You're completely correct when you say you can't limp behind in this spot. First of all, you're holding K6o, and second of all your stack will be less than a PSB on the flop facing three opponents, one of whom is likely to have outflopped you. The two that limped in before you likely have relatively weak hands. Any reasonably strong hand is probably going to be tossing out either a minraise to t800 or an open shove. You cannot make a play against either of those moves for obvious reasons. With two limps and K high, I would consider a shove over top here. Ideally in this stage you want to be the first one in the pot, but you aren't usually going to have your push called here by a hand that limps preflop with a relatively short stack. Against a range of **{77-22,A9s-A2s,K9s-K2s,A9o-A2o,K9o-K2o}** you have about 40% equity if you do get called, or about 1.5:1 odds to hit. This range seems reasonable given a preflop limp. If you get called here by one opponent, you've risked t1700 to win an additional t2500 (t1700 from the call, plus t800 from BB and the other limper). You are therefore getting roughly 1.5:1 on your money, making a shove here a correct play from a purely mathematical perspective, *even* if you're fairly certain you're going to get one caller. From a tournament perspective it gets a little less clear-cut. You're playing for your tournament life here, not in a cash game where you can reload. This is where the pay table starts to come into play. The rule of thumb is that if there are 3x the number of players remaining than the number of players who get paid, you ignore the bubble. This means that if 10 get paid, don't take the bubble into account if there are any more than 30 total players remaining in the tournament. Like I'd mentioned earlier, strictly speaking you want to be the first player in the pot when pushing with a chip stack your size. However, you're in an interesting position here because the big stack with ~t15000 is not in the hand, giving you a chance to actually make use of the small amount of fold equity you have left. Against a stack that size you have no fold equity whatsoever; you'll get called off with a ton of Ax/Kx hands, a lot of PPs, and likely even a lot of suited connectors. Against a ~t3200 stack though you're asking them to put in half their chips which people won't do with marginal hands, even if they already have dead money in the pot. This makes it a much better situational spot to push all-in, even though you wouldn't want to push here in a lot of similar spots. **tl;dr** This isn't a typical shove spot but based on stack sizes and your position I think a shove here is OK. You've got enough fold equity to scare off the two MP players and enough equity against their perceived range in case one of them calls. In this kind of spot you need to widen up your preflop shoving range and only play hands 'push-or-fold' preflop. You don't have the stack to be playing hands postflop until your CSI is up above 7 or 8 (with these blinds that would mean a stack of around t5000).I understand the blinds are going up quickly, but you should never find yourself with a stack size this low. Once you get down to a CSI of less than 8 (around 12 big blinds), you want to be trying for double-ups to get back to a workable stack size. It's better to bust out trying to double up than it is to be crippled and blinded out slowly, unless you're right on the bubble and just trying to squeak into the money.	The main rule is that if there are 3x the number of players remaining than the number of players who get paid, you ignore the bubble	1

Like I'd mentioned earlier, strictly speaking you want to be the first player in the pot when pushing with a chip stack your size. However, you're in an interesting position here because the big stack with ~t15000 is not in the hand, giving you a chance to actually make use of the small amount of fold equity you have left. Against a stack that size you have no fold equity whatsoever; you'll get called off with a ton of Ax/Kx hands, a lot of PPs, and likely even a lot of suited connectors. Against a ~t3200 stack though you're asking them to put in half their chips which people won't do with marginal hands, even if they already have dead money in the pot. This makes it a much better situational spot to push all-in, even though you wouldn't want to push here in a lot of similar spots. **tl;dr** This isn't a typical shove spot but based on stack sizes and your position I think a shove here is OK. You've got enough fold equity to scare off the two MP players and enough equity against their perceived range in case one of them calls. In this kind of spot you need to widen up your preflop shoving range and only play hands 'push-or-fold' preflop. You don't have the stack to be playing hands postflop until your CSI is up above 7 or 8 (with these blinds that would mean a stack of around t5000).I understand the blinds are going up quickly, but you should never find yourself with a stack size this low. Once you get down to a CSI of less than 8 (around 12 big blinds), you want to be trying for double-ups to get back to a workable stack size. It's better to bust out trying to double up than it is to be crippled and blinded out slowly, unless you're right on the bubble and just trying to squeak into the money.	The concept of finger is that if there are 3x the number of players remaining than the number of players who get paid, you ignore the bubble	0
rule of thumb	The rule of thumb is that if there are 3x the number of players remaining than the number of players who get paid, you ignore the bubble	With your stack size at t1700 and the CPR (cost per round) at t600, you're sitting with a CSI of under 3. This means that if you don't make a move this orbit, you're going to run out of opportunities to do so very quickly. I don't know why BB was preparing to muck in a limped pot unless a) he's completely clueless or b) he's shooting an angle with a monster and trying to entice you into getting it in. You're completely correct when you say you can't limp behind in this spot. First of all, you're holding K6o, and second of all your stack will be less than a PSB on the flop facing three opponents, one of whom is likely to have outflopped you. The two that limped in before you likely have relatively weak hands. Any reasonably strong hand is probably going to be tossing out either a minraise to t800 or an open shove. You cannot make a play against either of those moves for obvious reasons. With two limps and K high, I would consider a shove over top here. Ideally in this stage you want to be the first one in the pot, but you aren't usually going to have your push called here by a hand that limps preflop with a relatively short stack. Against a range of **{77-22,A9s-A2s,K9s-K2s,A9o-A2o,K9o-K2o}** you have about 40% equity if you do get called, or about 1.5:1 odds to hit. This range seems reasonable given a preflop limp. If you get called here by one opponent, you've risked t1700 to win an additional t2500 (t1700 from the call, plus t800 from BB and the other limper). You are therefore getting roughly 1.5:1 on your money, making a shove here a correct play from a purely mathematical perspective, *even* if you're fairly certain you're going to get one caller. From a tournament perspective it gets a little less clear-cut. You're playing for your tournament life here, not in a cash game where you can reload. This is where the pay table starts to come into play. The rule of thumb is that if there are 3x the number of players remaining than the number of players who get paid, you ignore the bubble. This means that if 10 get paid, don't take the bubble into account if there are any more than 30 total players remaining in the tournament.

in the face of	That meant more debt, but if done right, it would also create jobs and investment that were desperately needed in the face of the catastrophe that had just happened	"What is happenning today is the result of 40 years of mismanagement. I am not going to go into excessive detail, but lets start with this. Somewhere around 2002, right after the internet bubble crashed, investors all over the world realized that there weren't many options available that could drive long term real economic growth.When I say investors, I mean the people and institutions (such as banks, mutual funds, hedge funds and the like) that are responsible for safeguarding the world's savings. Let's say a grandmother in Kazakhstan has some $100 in a bank account. The bank is responsible for making that money grow so that it beats inflation. Combine all bank accounts, all retirement accounts, all 401Ks, all government savings, and every single bit of money saved in a banking or investment institution. We will call this the ""global giant pool of money"".All of this money must be invested somewhere. Preferably, somewhere that is extremely safe, but also that it offers a return that beats inflation.For a hundred years, the safest investment has been US Government Debt. However, the US Government is not very good at driving short-term economic growth. And with the US losing jobs in 2002 and heading towards a stagnation, the Federal Reserve decided to take a huge risk that, they thought, would spur economic growth, but that some people, even today, consider irresponsible: they set interest rates lower than inflation.All of a sudden, investors all over the world began looking for an investment that offered similar safety to US government debt, but that offered better returns.At the same time, the US government, then headed by George W. Bush, started borrowing massively to finance 2 wars (in Iraq and Afghanistan), irresponsible tax breaks, and, not significantly for the US government's deficit, but significant to what happened later, special incentives on home ownership. Mr. Bush's government also heavily relaxed oversight and regulation on banks.You see, banks quickly discovered that investors looking for safe bets and high returns loved ultra-safe mortgages. So, investment bankers created a financial device by which they would buy the commercial banks' mortgages, pack them into bonds, and sell the bonds to investors. When people owning homes made payment on these homes, the investors would get paid. The Investment Bankers were paid a comission to find these types of bonds, so that created an incentive for them to make as many of these bonds as possible.At the same time, a major shift in commercial banking occured. While, in the past, the bank held the risk of non-payment for mortgages (that is, they were liable to losing money if they lent money to someone who couldn't pay), now the bank no longer had this risk. The risk was now held by the investors! The bank could make money by selling the mortgages at a premium of what they created them for. (Let's say they lent a homeowner $250K. They sold the mortgage for $275K, and at 3% a year for 30 years, the investor could easily double its money over time). So, the banks still made money, only quicker and with less risk! Now the incentive on the banks was to lend as much money as possible.This led to massive fraud, in which banks would lend money to people with no credit-worthiness. There are cases were illegal immigrants with no documents and no fixed income would get loans to buy $750K homes. This created a ""housing bubble"" or ""real estate bubble"" that would eventually crash.The crash came in the late 2006 and early 2007. Somewhere around that time, home values stopped climbing. They didn't decline immediately, but it was only a matter of time. With people starting to default on their homes, investors on mortgage bonds started losing money by mid 2007. By late 2007, everybody knew the housing bubble was nothing but a massive fraud that was hurting millions of people around the world, losing their homes, shirts and savings. But the worse was yet to come...In early 2008, people discovered that some of the biggest investors on fraudulent mortgage bonds were the same investment banks that created them in the first place. Why? So they could keep the fantasy going a few months more, and make money for management's golden parachutes. In March of 2008, one of the oldest investment banks in America, Bear Sterns, collapsed under the weight of their mortgage exposure. The fed ""rescued"" it by forcing JP Morgan to buy it and giving them a very attractive loan as incentive.By August of 2008, it became clear that ALL investment banks were heavily exposed. But the size of the exposure was not at all clear to the market. The smallest investment bank (which is like saying ""the shortest giant"") hinted heavily that they either got a bailout from the government, or they would collapse. The market feared that a collapse of this bank, called Lehman Brothers, would trigger a collapse of all banks in America and the World. The US Government, still led by Mr. Bush, decided that saving Lehman would create a ""moral hazard"", that is, an incentive for bankers to make stupid mistakes with the expectation that the government would save them. The government decided not to save Lehman, and it collapsed. The next day, all markets around the world crashed, triggering a Global Financial Crisis.By October, all investment banks in America were bankrupt. The Wall Street Journal called it ""The End of Wall Street"", and the US Government asked Congress for a $700 billion bailout. They later admitted this number wouldn't be enough to save the economy, but only proposed it because ""it was the biggest number they could think of"". Remember, by this point, no one knows how much ""toxic assets"", as the mortgage bonds are now called, are held by the banks.But then, something even worse happened. The greatest insurer in America, AIG, was called upon to pay for the insurance they sold on the bonds. You see, should the mortgage bonds default, some investors hired insurance on them so that the insurance company would pay for their losses. AIG sold insurance on most of these bonds. AIG collapsed as a consequence, and the US Government had to authorize yet ANOTHER bailout for AIG.At this point you may be asking, why was a bailout of AIG and the banks necessary? Well, remember, the bank's money and the insurers money isn't theirs. It is the property of the investors and the people with savings accounts, and the people who had been paying insurance on time. Should these companies go under, millions of savers and investors all over the world would lose their money. Hundreds of Thousands did anyway, but the bailout helped contain the effects, which could have easily been hundreds of times worse. Remember, the market crash originally happened due to a failure to bail out Lehman.By January 2009, when Mr. Obama took office, the dust had settled, and it was clear that Mr. Bush's legacy was one of financial disaster that would guarantee at least a decade of econonmic recession. To make matter worse, the national debt, already huge due to the wars and the tax breaks and social security and medicare, was now even bigger due to the bailouts of the financial institutions. Mr. Obama's team, guided by some of the best economists in the world, some of them winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics, designed a plan for recovery that involved massive government spending. That meant more debt, but if done right, it would also create jobs and investment that were desperately needed in the face of the catastrophe that had just happened. Due to Republican opposition in Congress, the recovery plan was approved only in part, and so the recovery was lackluster at best.In 2010, the Republicans won the House, and immediatlet put a stop to Mr. Obama's recovery plan, with the excuse of ""curtailing the national debt"". Remember, the debt wasn't created by Mr. Obama, but was inherited by him. Most of the debt was created by his predecessor. Still, the House's irresponsbile behaviour when setting budgets, negotiating a rise in the debt ceiling, and in fostering recovery has made some investors nervous that political resentment in Washington will be stronger than America's economic position, threatening a longer recession or even a depression. This has led to one rating agency saying that the US government is no longer the most trust worthy investment in the world. It is among the most trust worthy, but not THE most. Naturally, this has incentived investors to seek safety, pulling money away from productive investment, into fixed assets such as gold and silver. If ever there was a self-fulfilling prophecy, this was it."

I am not going to go into excessive detail, but lets start with this. Somewhere around 2002, right after the internet bubble crashed, investors all over the world realized that there weren't many options available that could drive long term real economic growth.When I say investors, I mean the people and institutions (such as banks, mutual funds, hedge funds and the like) that are responsible for safeguarding the world's savings. Let's say a grandmother in Kazakhstan has some $100 in a bank account. The bank is responsible for making that money grow so that it beats inflation. Combine all bank accounts, all retirement accounts, all 401Ks, all government savings, and every single bit of money saved in a banking or investment institution. We will call this the ""global giant pool of money"".All of this money must be invested somewhere. Preferably, somewhere that is extremely safe, but also that it offers a return that beats inflation.For a hundred years, the safest investment has been US Government Debt. However, the US Government is not very good at driving short-term economic growth. And with the US losing jobs in 2002 and heading towards a stagnation, the Federal Reserve decided to take a huge risk that, they thought, would spur economic growth, but that some people, even today, consider irresponsible: they set interest rates lower than inflation.All of a sudden, investors all over the world began looking for an investment that offered similar safety to US government debt, but that offered better returns.At the same time, the US government, then headed by George W. Bush, started borrowing massively to finance 2 wars (in Iraq and Afghanistan), irresponsible tax breaks, and, not significantly for the US government's deficit, but significant to what happened later, special incentives on home ownership. Mr. Bush's government also heavily relaxed oversight and regulation on banks.You see, banks quickly discovered that investors looking for safe bets and high returns loved ultra-safe mortgages. So, investment bankers created a financial device by which they would buy the commercial banks' mortgages, pack them into bonds, and sell the bonds to investors. When people owning homes made payment on these homes, the investors would get paid. The Investment Bankers were paid a comission to find these types of bonds, so that created an incentive for them to make as many of these bonds as possible.At the same time, a major shift in commercial banking occured. While, in the past, the bank held the risk of non-payment for mortgages (that is, they were liable to losing money if they lent money to someone who couldn't pay), now the bank no longer had this risk. The risk was now held by the investors! The bank could make money by selling the mortgages at a premium of what they created them for. (Let's say they lent a homeowner $250K. They sold the mortgage for $275K, and at 3% a year for 30 years, the investor could easily double its money over time). So, the banks still made money, only quicker and with less risk! Now the incentive on the banks was to lend as much money as possible.This led to massive fraud, in which banks would lend money to people with no credit-worthiness. There are cases were illegal immigrants with no documents and no fixed income would get loans to buy $750K homes. This created a ""housing bubble"" or ""real estate bubble"" that would eventually crash.The crash came in the late 2006 and early 2007. Somewhere around that time, home values stopped climbing. They didn't decline immediately, but it was only a matter of time. With people starting to default on their homes, investors on mortgage bonds started losing money by mid 2007. By late 2007, everybody knew the housing bubble was nothing but a massive fraud that was hurting millions of people around the world, losing their homes, shirts and savings.

on the table	Not sure if that particular bill passed or if Obama would let it through, but that's the kind of cuts that are on the table and are also part of the recent debt ceiling agreement	&gt; If you oppose it on financial grounds, you don't.In terms of its absolute value, no. But it does say a whole lot about the priorities of both parties, and the GOP in particular. A whole number of programs of equal or smaller size are being cut, like for example food assistance to low-income mothers and children at the tune of less than $1 billion. Not sure if that particular bill passed or if Obama would let it through, but that's the kind of cuts that are on the table and are also part of the recent debt ceiling agreement.So I would characterize this as inherently unjust, even if you want to approach this from a purely financial perspective.

cut both ways	And this can cut both ways	"&gt; Wow to your initiatives regarding unregulated telecommunications networks! Really interesting and so so obviously the only real way forward, and you and your partner are going there :)Actually, my partner and I are involved in the alternative energy project, even though we both migrated to this project from the wireless communications industry.&gt; In short, I specialise in looking for and databasing every administrative and procedural flaw in legislation and subordinate legislation, so that I can at a root level disrupt the application of just about any piece of legislation out there.Let me see if I understand you correctly. You are cataloging lesser known archaic laws and bring them to the forefront when they serve your purposes? That's nothing short of brilliant.&gt; Also, like you, I don't do this to ""break"" the law for a client, but to force a change - a change in the making of laws in SA so that their logical and rational procedural foundations can serve their purpose of being a bulwark against the failure of the rule of law.I did something like that and created a bit of a stir when I used technology that was newly introduced, primarily targeted for indoor use, to connect buildings across the street from each other. No one knew what to do or if any of the existing laws applied (including me) which was kind of unnerving at first but became increasingly more Monty Pythonesque as several regulatory bodies at first battled to see which of them had jurisdiction and one after another all realized that they didn't. Finally, the FCC clarified the regulations and allowed us to continue. In the interest of full disclosure, I was part of a small group who engaged in this and it was quite interesting to watch.What I learned from this experience is that the pace at which technology is introduced is far quicker than today's lawmakers can keep pace with or even begin to understand. The end effect is that we see draconian legislation introduced and sometimes passed into law that is counterproductive to society's best interest but which then spurs another technological leap forward and the cycle continues.&gt; But the lesson I've learnt is, that where something is as clear as a bell for me, others' understanding of it is like wading through mud, and they most often choose to skirt the edges of the quagmire they perceive me as pointing them towards.And this can cut both ways. Sometimes their inability to fully grasp the subject works to our advantage and other times it creates roadblocks that are time consuming to overcome - but I'm sure you understand that.&gt; Very interesting synergy in your and my recognition of the obsolete or useless, and focus on driving change from out the box, isn't there? I'm not sure where this can go, but being what we are, I'm sure we'll find interesting directions.Absolutely.I think where we best compliment each other is through the diversification of our skill sets. As part of what I need to know, I touch on legal and regulatory issues quite regularly even though my core competency is technology. I would suggest that you do the reverse, as you certainly understand the net and the associated technology but specialize in the law.So, the question before the house is, how do we attract more like-minded people to this discussion?

from time to time	Even if he gave you shit for it, you'd still have breakouts from time to time	1st scenario, the guy with the voice: All surgeries carry risk. Surgery on the vocal cords isn't something you just do because you want to. A screw up or a bad reaction to medicine or even natural scarring caused by healing after surgery could fuck him up, making the problem worse, or even impairing his ability to talk. And it's not like it's causing him physical pain or something. The psoriasis thing- yeah, I can see the doctor being a bit of a dick about that. He should at least give you a cream or something. But that's an incurable condition. Even if he gave you shit for it, you'd still have breakouts from time to time. It's just a personal thing you're going to have to battle with, just like a person who was born really short. tl;dr; life sucks. Doctors can be dicks, but you can't go running off having major surgery just because your body is a little weird. And seriously- if your doctor isn't making you happy- go get another one.

in the same breath	"I agree that mentioning Amy Winehouse in the same breath as the ""27 Death Club,"" or whatever people call it, is premature"	"Thank you for your clemency, oh grand dictator of all that is good in music. Personally, what it boils down to for me with Jim Morrison is that people buy a bit too much into his legend, which got overinflated after his untimely death. And that rubs me wrong. Jimi's legend is deserved. John Lennon's is. To me, Jim Morrison's is not, or at least the level  he receives. I agree that mentioning Amy Winehouse in the same breath as the ""27 Death Club,"" or whatever people call it, is premature. She was really just a very good throwback act, and not really an innovator, but nobody has pretended otherwise. I think people are upset with the wasted talent and potential.

I can recognize a handful of hiragana characters, but that's about it.  It'd be easier if the syllabary at least was consistent in indicating the relationship between syllables (same vowel, same consonant--like the Hindic script system).I will grant that white Americans do have it better than some minority groups (mostly because white Americans have *money*), but don't kid yourself: they still believe in blood purity (a ridiculous notion to most Americans, sure, but when the country is that homogenous, it has more currency).Just don't go blowing the money from your job on porn/life sized figurines of TEH REI, for the sake of any American that may want to take a vacation in Japan someday.

behind the scenes	"The OS, behind the scenes, says ""Okay, the user says he wants to quit this app, but I don't technically *need* to do anything else with the resources it's consuming right now … so I'll just let it keep running with no UI, so it can be restarted quickly"	"Automatic termination.It's not really a user-facing feature. In fact, it's specifically designed to be invisible. But it essentially revolutionizes the concept of virtual memory.Back in the old days, you had *X* amount of physical memory in your computer, and that meant you could allocate *X* amount of memory total, divided up among all your programs. If you needed to run a program that required more memory than you had available, you'd get an error message. You'd then have to choose some other program (or programs) to terminate, to free up enough memory to run the new one. This was good, because you could run multiple programs at once, but it sucked because you were constrained by how much memory you had.Then virtual memory came, and it broke the connection between memory allocation and physical RAM. Every program on your computer could, in principle, allocate *all possible memory,* up to the limit of whatever addressing scheme your operating system used. If the programs on your computer tried to allocate more memory than you had physical RAM, the OS would start ""paging"" the contents of physical RAM out to disk, freeing up those pages for new allocations. But it'd leave pointers behind, so whenever an application tried to fetch something from memory that had been paged out, the OS would pick some other pages that hadn't been used recently, page *those* out, and then page the wanted memory back *in.*This was good, because you weren't constrained by how much physical RAM you had any more. But it sucked because paging was *incredibly* slow. So slow that your computer could easily become unresponsive. So in a lot of ways, frankly, *not* paging to disk was better.Lion takes this idea further, starting with the concept of a restorable window. All document windows are restorable by default, as long as the document isn't in an unsaved state. Programs can be modified, pretty trivially, to support automatic restoration for other types of windows as well, plus there's the autosave feature which makes document windows restorable all the time. Beyond that, there's the idea of automatic termination, which is a flag an app can set in its property list file. When that flag is set, unless the app makes a specific system call to declare itself *not* automatically-terminatable, the app is in the automatic-termination state whenever all its windows are restorable.What's this mean? It means if you have a compliant app running, and that app is *not actively doing something right now,* whenever the OS gets into a state Apple calls ""memory pressure,"" where it's running out of physical memory to allocate, the OS will silently and instantly kill your app's process. It won't bother paging the app's memory pages out to disk, because the *state* of the application is already preserved, through restoration. So it doesn't *need* to page the app's memory out to disk, or bother reading them back in later. It can just *kill the app dead,* then restore its state later when you go back to the app.It's basically the equivalent of a car automatically turning off the engine when you idle.What it means in practice is that the connection between apps that are running and processes in the process table (and allocated physical memory pages, and open file descriptors, and all those other resources processes consume) has been broken, and then replaced with an abstraction. You can have apps ""running"" on your computer — they have dock icons, they can receive notifications, all that — that have no process associated with them.And the other side of the coin is also true. Say you're on a system with more physical memory than you actually need at the moment, like an eight-gig laptop or something. You fire off an app, like Mail say, and do something, then you quit the app. The OS, behind the scenes, says ""Okay, the user says he wants to quit this app, but I don't technically *need* to do anything else with the resources it's consuming right now … so I'll just let it keep running with no UI, so it can be restarted quickly.""

In fact, it's specifically designed to be invisible. But it essentially revolutionizes the concept of virtual memory.Back in the old days, you had *X* amount of physical memory in your computer, and that meant you could allocate *X* amount of memory total, divided up among all your programs. If you needed to run a program that required more memory than you had available, you'd get an error message. You'd then have to choose some other program (or programs) to terminate, to free up enough memory to run the new one. This was good, because you could run multiple programs at once, but it sucked because you were constrained by how much memory you had.Then virtual memory came, and it broke the connection between memory allocation and physical RAM. Every program on your computer could, in principle, allocate *all possible memory,* up to the limit of whatever addressing scheme your operating system used. If the programs on your computer tried to allocate more memory than you had physical RAM, the OS would start ""paging"" the contents of physical RAM out to disk, freeing up those pages for new allocations. But it'd leave pointers behind, so whenever an application tried to fetch something from memory that had been paged out, the OS would pick some other pages that hadn't been used recently, page *those* out, and then page the wanted memory back *in.*This was good, because you weren't constrained by how much physical RAM you had any more. But it sucked because paging was *incredibly* slow. So slow that your computer could easily become unresponsive. So in a lot of ways, frankly, *not* paging to disk was better.Lion takes this idea further, starting with the concept of a restorable window. All document windows are restorable by default, as long as the document isn't in an unsaved state. Programs can be modified, pretty trivially, to support automatic restoration for other types of windows as well, plus there's the autosave feature which makes document windows restorable all the time. Beyond that, there's the idea of automatic termination, which is a flag an app can set in its property list file. When that flag is set, unless the app makes a specific system call to declare itself *not* automatically-terminatable, the app is in the automatic-termination state whenever all its windows are restorable.What's this mean? It means if you have a compliant app running, and that app is *not actively doing something right now,* whenever the OS gets into a state Apple calls ""memory pressure,"" where it's running out of physical memory to allocate, the OS will silently and instantly kill your app's process. It won't bother paging the app's memory pages out to disk, because the *state* of the application is already preserved, through restoration. So it doesn't *need* to page the app's memory out to disk, or bother reading them back in later. It can just *kill the app dead,* then restore its state later when you go back to the app.It's basically the equivalent of a car automatically turning off the engine when you idle.What it means in practice is that the connection between apps that are running and processes in the process table (and allocated physical memory pages, and open file descriptors, and all those other resources processes consume) has been broken, and then replaced with an abstraction. You can have apps ""running"" on your computer — they have dock icons, they can receive notifications, all that — that have no process associated with them.And the other side of the coin is also true.

a good deal	I am very interested in discussing these ideas because, to be perfectly honest with you, I think a good deal of them make a lot of sense	"&gt; Don't you really think most people want human life to be respected? Aren't they just scared or clueless? I think so.I used to believe that most people respected the value of life until this country lost its collective mind just after 9/11. Now I have come to believe that these values which we profess to hold dear can be perverted on a moment's notice.&gt; I think each person is the most competent to run her own life, because she is the one who pays for the mistakes. But this is not true in many if not most cases. When someone murders a person, do you not agree that the friends and family of the victim also pay?

bells and whistles	If you can, just buy a cheap small tube of some generic KY, or something that's cheap with no bells and whistles	If its price you are concerned about when trying to find the right one. Have a hunt for mixed packets at a chemist (drug store?) Something like [Ansell Allsorts](http://www.ansellcondoms.com.au/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=16) Which have different types of condoms to play around with, all in one box at regular prices.If you are still at the solo-testing stage, you can also try finding different brands of free-bies at Health clinics and family planning centers. Often they get free condoms from several different brands, So you can pick up a different brand to try.Pharmacies/Chemists sell condoms.Some Gas stations sell condoms.Most variety/grocery stores (walmart, Target, woollies etc) sell condoms.As for lube. (I am assuming you are straight) It all depends on who you plan to have sex with. If you can, just buy a cheap small tube of some generic KY, or something that's cheap with no bells and whistles. That way you have it if you need it.Now days most condoms come with a little bit of lube on them, and if you focus on foreplay your partner might have enought natural lubrication to make it work.I would not recommend buying any fancy warming, Cooling or numbing lubes until you talk to your sex partner. My boyfriend went out and bought $50 worth of fancy lubes, Before talking to me. I have allergies and every bottle of lube would hurt me, so we had to go shopping again.If you plan on having anal sex, or your partner has expressed that she has difficulties with wetness, Defiantly invest in a slightly larger tube of lube.(Otherwise, pinch some sachets from the family planning center when you grab some condoms to test.)

The problem is he didnt have anything to lead up with.  Even after college he'd ask girls ""what was your major?"" One time, we were taking a road trip with a girl he like and of course (the whole car, except her, knew it was coming) he asks her ""whats your major"".  This breaks the ice and they begin chit-chatting.  A few minutes later the conversation goes stale and the dreaded ""dead silence"" creeps in.  He turns to her and asks ""so what was your major?""

Preferably one of them has a wife or a girlfriend you get along with. Women make great listeners, and you'll feel more comfortable talking to them about it if you want to, especially if you're good friends with them. Get drunk. Not black out drunk, even though it'll be a temptation. Get just drunk enough so shit doesn't matter so much anymore. Do something fun. Go to the lake, go to the beach, go do something that doesn't involve thinking or feeling. Lastly, don't fuck other girls. Somewhere down the road, yes. But for right now, you won't enjoy it while you're doing it, and you'll feel like shit about it afterward. TL;DR Just be around some good friends, get some booze in you, and do something that takes your mind off of it, that doesn't involve vagina	Somewhere later, yes	1

food for thought	Just food for thought	To go along with the other engineers advice, if the bed post is in face small/pointed, a piece of steel plate (2x2, 3x3) under each point, on top of the foam, would distribute the weight better.  That way you can look at things that are able to do lets say 50lbs/square inch rather than something that has to do 100 - 150 lbs / square inch.  It does not need to be centered either, but you will get disproportionate compression of your foam if you get into any sort of extreme offest (&lt;20% displacement from true center in any direction).  Just food for thought.  If you need help getting supplies or something cut I work with a machining lab on my campus and would be more than happy to cut/size/provide these pieces for you.  If you do go this route, it might be helpful to get the size of the post that would be going into this (shape to) so that I could machine a recess for the leg to fit into.	Just information	1

You stand to gain a lot if RBS ever returns to its previous highs, but there's still a huge amount of risk involving their exposure to European debt.

out of the blue	This was out of the blue as far as we were concerned	"the escapist response&gt;Hey guys. This is Alexander Macris. I'm the publisher. Jame's statements are very one-sided so I think they deserve a response.Yes, we are having a very unfortunate dispute with James over Extra Credits, and yes, he's planning to leave The Escapist, despite our repeated requests that he stay. It's also true that we fell behind in paying James.Here are the key facts as I see them:1. From November 2010 to June 2011, James told us not to worry about paying him and to focus on paying other people. His exact words were ""I really don’t want to squeeze you guys if you’re in a crunch, so you can put us to the bottom of the list for right now…"" Given that we have been in a crunch due to the recession, we took him at his word, thanked him profusely for the flexibility, and focused on paying down other debt. (Several other shows were cancelled around November 2010 you'll recall, as we couldn't pay them, but James' flexibility allowed us to keep working with him to promote Extra Credits.)2. This continued until June 2011, when James emailed us to alert us that he needed funds urgently. The request was partly for family matters and partly for Allison's surgery. He asked for our permission to raise funds through Kickstarter. We more than gave permission, we threw our weight into supporting it. Unfortunately, Kickstarter refused because they don't do charity. I then suggested James try RocketHub and RocketHub agreed. We again collaborated to make it a joint effort. Our agreement was that we would be compensated for the wholesale cost of the t-shirts and Publisher's Club, and that the funds would be used to save Extra Credits. I reasonably interpreted ""save Extra Credits"" to mean that anything beyond what was needed for Allison's surgery would be used on Extra Credits production. I also Pay-palled James as much money as we had available at that time.3. After the RocketHub was enormously successful and James had decided to use the funds to create an indie publishing label rather than to ""save Extra Credits"", James decided he would no longer speak to us directly and instead assigned a ""business development manager"" to speak to us. James' new business development manager demanded that we assign all the IP of Extra Credits to James.4. We indicated we would be happy to work out an IP transfer but that before we did that, we would like to make sure we got paid for the wholesale cost of the t-shirts and the Publisher's Club memberships, and that we would like to see the Extra Credits RocketHub money used to create more Extra Credits. We did NOT ask that James send us $9,500 - we said he should use $9,500 to create more episodes of the show that the money was supposed to be used to save.5. James' business development manager at that time emailed me and told us that his position was now that we had no rights to the show, no deal, and that our entire contract was invalid. This was out of the blue as far as we were concerned. We had no understanding at this time of James' intent to use the ""Save Extra Credits"" money to start a publishing business.6. At this point, Russ Pitts, our editor in chief, flew out to meet with James and his business development manager personally. They agreed that we would continue to work together; that we would transfer the IP to James in exchange for some fee to be negotiated; and that James would handle the EC t-shirts directly rather than through us. We agreed to swallow the cost of the Publisher's Club memberships, a few thousand dollars.7. I then emailed James and his business development manager to explain that I wanted to get them paid as quickly as possible so that the back debt was not a sticking point in negotiations. I then emailed them again to say that I had talked to our Board and investors and that payment would come in about a week.8. At this point, James had his lawyer send us an email stating that we were in breach and that unless we sent money more quickly than I had just stated we'd be able to send it, that James was terminating his relationship with us. I presume that James thought we were playing games with him, although we were not.9. We went ahead and mailed James the money we got from our investors the next week as we had promised. James' lawyer nevertheless sent us an email indicating they intended to terminate our agreement.10. Finally, I should add that as of last week, we had paid James over $14,000 of the $20,000 we owed him, and that as of today, our company has mailed James all payments he is owed.I have all of this documented extensively in email. James is simply in error if he believes we have ever lied to him or any of his staff. We are prepared to defend ourselves against future defamation in a court of law.Cordial regards,Alexander Macris"	This was suddenly as far as we were concerned	1

Jame's statements are very one-sided so I think they deserve a response.Yes, we are having a very unfortunate dispute with James over Extra Credits, and yes, he's planning to leave The Escapist, despite our repeated requests that he stay. It's also true that we fell behind in paying James.Here are the key facts as I see them:1. From November 2010 to June 2011, James told us not to worry about paying him and to focus on paying other people. His exact words were ""I really don’t want to squeeze you guys if you’re in a crunch, so you can put us to the bottom of the list for right now…"" Given that we have been in a crunch due to the recession, we took him at his word, thanked him profusely for the flexibility, and focused on paying down other debt. (Several other shows were cancelled around November 2010 you'll recall, as we couldn't pay them, but James' flexibility allowed us to keep working with him to promote Extra Credits.)2. This continued until June 2011, when James emailed us to alert us that he needed funds urgently. The request was partly for family matters and partly for Allison's surgery. He asked for our permission to raise funds through Kickstarter. We more than gave permission, we threw our weight into supporting it. Unfortunately, Kickstarter refused because they don't do charity. I then suggested James try RocketHub and RocketHub agreed. We again collaborated to make it a joint effort. Our agreement was that we would be compensated for the wholesale cost of the t-shirts and Publisher's Club, and that the funds would be used to save Extra Credits. I reasonably interpreted ""save Extra Credits"" to mean that anything beyond what was needed for Allison's surgery would be used on Extra Credits production. I also Pay-palled James as much money as we had available at that time.3. After the RocketHub was enormously successful and James had decided to use the funds to create an indie publishing label rather than to ""save Extra Credits"", James decided he would no longer speak to us directly and instead assigned a ""business development manager"" to speak to us. James' new business development manager demanded that we assign all the IP of Extra Credits to James.4. We indicated we would be happy to work out an IP transfer but that before we did that, we would like to make sure we got paid for the wholesale cost of the t-shirts and the Publisher's Club memberships, and that we would like to see the Extra Credits RocketHub money used to create more Extra Credits. We did NOT ask that James send us $9,500 - we said he should use $9,500 to create more episodes of the show that the money was supposed to be used to save.5. James' business development manager at that time emailed me and told us that his position was now that we had no rights to the show, no deal, and that our entire contract was invalid. This was out of the blue as far as we were concerned. We had no understanding at this time of James' intent to use the ""Save Extra Credits"" money to start a publishing business.6. At this point, Russ Pitts, our editor in chief, flew out to meet with James and his business development manager personally. They agreed that we would continue to work together; that we would transfer the IP to James in exchange for some fee to be negotiated; and that James would handle the EC t-shirts directly rather than through us. We agreed to swallow the cost of the Publisher's Club memberships, a few thousand dollars.7. I then emailed James and his business development manager to explain that I wanted to get them paid as quickly as possible so that the back debt was not a sticking point in negotiations. I then emailed them again to say that I had talked to our Board and investors and that payment would come in about a week.8. At this point, James had his lawyer send us an email stating that we were in breach and that unless we sent money more quickly than I had just stated we'd be able to send it, that James was terminating his relationship with us. I presume that James thought we were playing games with him, although we were not.9. We went ahead and mailed James the money we got from our investors the next week as we had promised. James' lawyer nevertheless sent us an email indicating they intended to terminate our agreement.10. Finally, I should add that as of last week, we had paid James over $14,000 of the $20,000 we owed him, and that as of today, our company has mailed James all payments he is owed.I have all of this documented extensively in email. James is simply in error if he believes we have ever lied to him or any of his staff. We are prepared to defend ourselves against future defamation in a court of law.Cordial regards,Alexander Macris"	This was out of the azure as far as we were concerned	0

bite the bullet	You're just going to have to bite the bullet &amp; get through it	"It's very difficult sometimes to establish the point at which kid input stops being important.  It is important, but it can't always be the most important thing in the choices you have to make for your family.  This is probably not going to be the last fit she throws about the school, but just hang in there.  If she really starts **failing** you'll know: the teacher will tell you if she's not making friends and starts struggling with the school work.  But, there's a substantive difference between a 9 year old's perception of ""awful"" and actual awful.  You're just going to have to bite the bullet &amp; get through it.

hit the nail on the head	I think you hit the nail on the head of my experience with Best Buy people pointing to the fine print of the contract (or rather, it's on the medium sized print but not on the advertised concept)	Ahhh, I see.  Thanks for the answer.  I was dealing with a different Best Buy store management in the past, so maybe the local management philosophy or performance metrics have changed.  I've moved since then, so I'll try again at my new local store.I think you hit the nail on the head of my experience with Best Buy people pointing to the fine print of the contract (or rather, it's on the medium sized print but not on the advertised concept).  It's certainly valid from a legal perspective, but my perspective is that it's fatally damaging from a customer relations perspective.  I'll go through the process you described above and see what the service center verdict is, but this very concretely cements in my mind that extended warranties are a sham (as always said by Consumer Reports) rather than a great way to build a closer relationship between the business and long time customers.Anyway, none of the bureaucratic stuff is up to you, so thanks again for your help in navigating the system!

We use them for Sons of Guns and b-roll mostly. We shoot all of our recreations for crime documentaries on Canon 5D's.

odds and ends	And my retired Uncle, not so savvy, would go in with his MBP &amp; digital camera and just spend time with various odds and ends - he had a tremendous amount of praise for it as well	When I was living in Hawaii - I had 3 within a miles of my home (Kahala, Waikiki, and Ala Moana).  One morning I ran in quickly to grab a power cable for my buddy and an entire classroom of kids occupied one section.  I BS'd a bit with an employee and learned about the programs Apple offers to local schools for media related classrooms to come into the store, shoot video and learn the basics of editing along with the use of a nice selection of the in store machines.  What an awesome idea.  They were then playing the results of what the kids came up with on screens throughout the store - I was impressed and if i was a kid and had that opportunity?  I'd be so stoked.And services like One-to-One are gold if you take advantage.  A buddy of mine was doing some video work and paid for One-to-One and went in religiously to take advantage of it and spent the entire time in Final Cut.  And my retired Uncle, not so savvy, would go in with his MBP &amp; digital camera and just spend time with various odds and ends - he had a tremendous amount of praise for it as well.I'm just curious if any of the tables in the photo's have cash drawers - as many tables in the stores I frequented had hidden cash drawers that popped out once you completed a transaction and needed change.  Though I assume those are pulled out and just not visible in the photo....

get away with murder	Don't think Ron Paul wouldn't let these assholes get away with murder just like Romney would	I'm going to be honest and say that nothing Ron Paul said really negated what Mitt Romney said. Ron Paul said that rights fall back to the individual just as Romney stressed that corporations are an entity of people and a sum of their parts. If anything, he was beating around the question.

matter of time	And it's only a matter of time before someone realizes if they start a private bus company, or a private park, etc	If you were referring to me as taking RP's view out of context, I sincerly wasn't. I was referencing to the attitude of zaferk, who seems to think legal discrimination is fine and just.Regarding RP's view, I can understand where he would be coming from, but I have to vehemently oppose. It's just a step backward. It would be NICE if people would stand up in opposition, but I think we both know that wouldn't happen all over. Maybe in more urban, liberal cities, but in a lot of back woods towns things like this would slide. And it's only a matter of time before someone realizes if they start a private bus company, or a private park, etc., that they can deny usage to Muslims, Blacks, Jews, who ever they want! And there is no one to stop them. What's to stop multiple people from doing this and making it nearly impossible for certain groups to live in certain places?

out of whack	We're completely out of whack with the rest of the world *right now*, never mind in 10 years time	It's a complex problem that's for sure.  And to actually make a meaningful impact, everybody (ourselves included) is going to have to do a lot more than they have currently committed to.But you have to start somewhere right?  China and India are both growing sources of emissions, it's true.  But they have valid reasons (i.e. millions living in abject poverty) for continuing to grow their overall emissions, while still seeking to improve their per-GDP performance.  We have no such excuse.It just seems to me to be rather inequitable to sit in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and claim that action is too expensive, while simultaneously pointing the finger at places like India and China and saying that *they* are the real problem.But that kind of moralistic grandstanding doesn't win people over, and I understand that entirely.  So lets look at it from another perspective:In a perfect world, what would a final solution to the problem look like?  Assuming that it is impossible to completely eliminate all CO2 emissions, a fair system would enable each country to have a quota of emissions, based on population.  The emissions per capita for every country would be the same (although you'd allow trading and other adjustments).Working backwards from that final solution then, ask yourself which countries have to improve their performance the most?  We do.  We're completely out of whack with the rest of the world *right now*, never mind in 10 years time.  If we can't recognise that, and accept the need to reform our economy, then how can we ask anyone else it to do it?

And to actually make a meaningful impact, everybody (ourselves included) is going to have to do a lot more than they have currently committed to.But you have to start somewhere right?  China and India are both growing sources of emissions, it's true.  But they have valid reasons (i.e. millions living in abject poverty) for continuing to grow their overall emissions, while still seeking to improve their per-GDP performance.  We have no such excuse.It just seems to me to be rather inequitable to sit in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and claim that action is too expensive, while simultaneously pointing the finger at places like India and China and saying that *they* are the real problem.But that kind of moralistic grandstanding doesn't win people over, and I understand that entirely.  So lets look at it from another perspective:In a perfect world, what would a final solution to the problem look like?  Assuming that it is impossible to completely eliminate all CO2 emissions, a fair system would enable each country to have a quota of emissions, based on population.  The emissions per capita for every country would be the same (although you'd allow trading and other adjustments).Working backwards from that final solution then, ask yourself which countries have to improve their performance the most?  We do.  We're completely out of whack with the rest of the world *right now*, never mind in 10 years time.  If we can't recognise that, and accept the need to reform our economy, then how can we ask anyone else it to do it?

out of pocket	Dan and I work on it for free and I pay Allison’s salary out of pocket each month, then, in turn, The Escapist was supposed to pay us for our work - not much, but enough to cover Allison’s wages - unfortunately they were never able to	Since nobody seems to understand linebreaks or paragraphs &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;&gt;Hi GuysI’m sorry about a lot of things over the last month. I’m sorry that I’ve been incommunicative. I’m sorry that I’ve been snappish. I’m sorry that I haven’t talked to you about what’s been going on. It’s been a rough few weeks, but I can finally talk about it, so here’s what’s been happening with us…(this may take a bit, I'm sorry for spamming you too...)&gt;When Allison hurt her arm all I wanted was to help her. I believe that a person has a responsibility to those near them and you should feel shame when you can’t live up to that responsibility…but I couldn’t. I was near destitute. I had spent all my money on the show.&gt;Dan and I work on it for free and I pay Allison’s salary out of pocket each month, then, in turn, The Escapist was supposed to pay us for our work - not much, but enough to cover Allison’s wages - unfortunately they were never able to.&gt;When Allison hurt her arm, The Escapist had only paid us for four episodes over the course of a year. That meant I was down $20,000. That was the $20,000 I could have put in to help Allison. That was the $20,000 I would have used to get her surgery while figuring out how I could earn more money. It hurt that I couldn’t tell you that then but I was asked not to.&gt;I felt so bad asking without being able to do more than sell a computer and call in old debts…but you taught me a lesson in humanity and the goodness of people. I had never lost my faith in mankind, but that first Rockethub week you redoubled it.&gt;And that was truly one of the greatest weeks of my life. Better than releasing games, better than lecturing in the halls of GDC. I really can never say thank you enough.&gt;But since then things have not gone so well. We joined The Escapist because we believed in what was going on there. We believed in the idea of examining games more thoroughly, whether it was Yahtzee’s blunt honesty or ENN delivering game news, we liked the idea that it was a place where consumers and developers could have a real conversation about games. We believed we were all in this together, fighting for the same ideals and goals.&gt;We asked the guys at The Escapist if we could trade some of the debt they owed us for the rights to our intellectual property back if they weren’t going to be able to pay us so we could do things like sell t-shirts or write a book. We thought this was going to be an easy discussion. Instead they responded by telling us that they felt that they were entitled to 75% of the Rockethub money, thus their debt was covered and, despite not paying us for nearly a year, we owed them $9500 dollars&gt;What followed was weeks of legal wrangling, lies and muck. Unless you guys really care about the details I won’t go over them here. I do think The Escapist does some good, and I wouldn’t want to destroy what good it does with how they operate their business. I’m going to work under the idea that our situation was unique and that their other content creators are paid regularly and don’t have a contract that was as onerous as ours.&gt;Again: we don’t want to add to the damage done. I’m already kind of heartbroken that things turned out this way. I had faith in what The Escapist stood for. That faith is in tatters, but it doesn’t mean that there aren’t good people doing good things for The Escapist.&gt;What matters is that the show won’t stop. We’ll be releasing it on YouTube every Thursday until we find another site to pick it up.

out of pocket	Dan and I work on it for free and I pay Allison’s salary out of pocket each month, then, in turn, The Escapist was supposed to pay us for our work - not much, but enough to cover Allison’s wages - unfortunately they were never able to	Since nobody seems to understand linebreaks or paragraphs &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;&gt;Hi GuysI’m sorry about a lot of things over the last month. I’m sorry that I’ve been incommunicative. I’m sorry that I’ve been snappish. I’m sorry that I haven’t talked to you about what’s been going on. It’s been a rough few weeks, but I can finally talk about it, so here’s what’s been happening with us…(this may take a bit, I'm sorry for spamming you too...)&gt;When Allison hurt her arm all I wanted was to help her. I believe that a person has a responsibility to those near them and you should feel shame when you can’t live up to that responsibility…but I couldn’t. I was near destitute. I had spent all my money on the show.&gt;Dan and I work on it for free and I pay Allison’s salary out of pocket each month, then, in turn, The Escapist was supposed to pay us for our work - not much, but enough to cover Allison’s wages - unfortunately they were never able to.&gt;When Allison hurt her arm, The Escapist had only paid us for four episodes over the course of a year. That meant I was down $20,000. That was the $20,000 I could have put in to help Allison. That was the $20,000 I would have used to get her surgery while figuring out how I could earn more money. It hurt that I couldn’t tell you that then but I was asked not to.&gt;I felt so bad asking without being able to do more than sell a computer and call in old debts…but you taught me a lesson in humanity and the goodness of people. I had never lost my faith in mankind, but that first Rockethub week you redoubled it.&gt;And that was truly one of the greatest weeks of my life. Better than releasing games, better than lecturing in the halls of GDC. I really can never say thank you enough.&gt;But since then things have not gone so well. We joined The Escapist because we believed in what was going on there. We believed in the idea of examining games more thoroughly, whether it was Yahtzee’s blunt honesty or ENN delivering game news, we liked the idea that it was a place where consumers and developers could have a real conversation about games. We believed we were all in this together, fighting for the same ideals and goals.&gt;We asked the guys at The Escapist if we could trade some of the debt they owed us for the rights to our intellectual property back if they weren’t going to be able to pay us so we could do things like sell t-shirts or write a book. We thought this was going to be an easy discussion. Instead they responded by telling us that they felt that they were entitled to 75% of the Rockethub money, thus their debt was covered and, despite not paying us for nearly a year, we owed them $9500 dollars&gt;What followed was weeks of legal wrangling, lies and muck. Unless you guys really care about the details I won’t go over them here. I do think The Escapist does some good, and I wouldn’t want to destroy what good it does with how they operate their business. I’m going to work under the idea that our situation was unique and that their other content creators are paid regularly and don’t have a contract that was as onerous as ours.&gt;Again: we don’t want to add to the damage done.
