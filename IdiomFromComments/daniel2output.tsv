for the love of	BUT, can I say no to one comment, for the love of humanity, 10hours of meditating was enough	Ahh, I've just came back from a [Vipassana](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/j5n12/update_my_vipassana_experience/, too).   I would say I agreed with you about how he repeated somethings and skipped over others. I think the repetition was the core beliefs of the technique (the 'equanimity' aspect). Maybe to get them parts to sink into the mind at a deep level.   But, the other aspects were interesting, too, and he didn't delve into them enough; I've been having to research them online myself. Did you find for a course labelled as non-religious and non-sectarian it had a lot of Buddhism in it? Especially in the discourses? I didn't mind because I knew the technique was discovered by Buddha and is a form of Theravada Buddhism. I guess the technique itself is not religious but it's stems from it. Idk, it didn't offend me, I enjoyed the theory and parables.Did you also find that without the mask of talking you could see people as they really were? I thought it was an interesting side benefit of the noble silence.A lot of questions, sorry. Glad to see you had a good experience. Edit: I forgot to say I like how you've given a overview of the daily structure. It'll help people be aware.  BUT, can I say no to one comment, for the love of humanity, 10hours of meditating was enough. I was one of those who was restless at night. I survived on less than 4 hours and was still buzzing awake and alert.

I won't pretend to be a patent expert, but at face value, the iPad was a new product -- one hardly any of us even anticipated -- and now we see many iPad-like devices on the market.  In my non-expert opinion, this would seem to be pretty much precisely what patent law was intended to handle.

on the other hand	Karma on the other hand was created to be a balance between offense and defense	Just a clarification, "Karma needs farm" isn't just a myth people mimic mindlessly.  If you try playing Karma with farm and then play her without, you realize that it's not her base values nor her AP ratios that dictate whether or not she needs farm, it's the way her kit works.With 0 farm, both Janna and Karma have pretty similar values for their shield and spells.  The difference is Janna's kit doesn't depend on the numbers, but rather the effects of the spells.  A speed modifier, a AoE knockup to disrupt fights, an AoE knockback + heal, and a shield that buffs its target with 50 AD.  She can change the teamfight from a safe distance, regardless of the numbers on those spells.  It's the modifiers that make them powerful.Karma on the other hand was created to be a balance between offense and defense.  Her kit revolves around having to do damage AND support the team at the same time.  If you're not doing both of those things, you're useless and subpar compared to other heroes.  So in order to make her relevant, you need to be doing damage, which means you need AP.  To maximize the effectiveness of Karma's kit, you need survivability, AP, and CDR.  This is why Karma "needs" farm.  You don't need any farm to maximize the effectiveness of other supports' kits.	Karma alternatively was created to be a balance between offense and defense	1

tie up loose ends	I think the simple unbiased answer is that it takes time to tie up loose ends	I think the simple unbiased answer is that it takes time to tie up loose ends.  There's a fear that if we leave Afghanistan in a certain state, then a terrorist organization can train on Afghan soil.  If the Afghans aren't equipped to eradicate terrorist organizations, the concern is that they will be able to train and grow strong.  So, I think we are still there because we want to continue teaching the Afgans how to police their own land for terrorists.Ideally we don't want to be there, but I think we're afraid that if we leave right now, the Afghan people will allow terrorist organizations to grow strength and attack the US and its allies later, simply because the Afghan people don't have a very good track record when it comes to policing for terrorist organizations.Whether or not you agree that "if the US recognizes it as a terrorist organization, then it becomes one", we can still define it as a bunch of foreign nationals who are meeting together with weapons in an ability to organize and train for action of some sort.  That behavior should probably be policed anytime, anywhere it happens.  Basically if 200 armed guys come into your country and meet up in a training camp they built, we (the US) want to make sure you know how to break them up.  Things stay more organized if the only heavily armed and trained group in a given country is that country's military rather than something resembling a militia.This is an honest attempt at keeping all bias out of my answer.

slice of the pie	But while we still have a world where in order for one person to have a 2nd helping another person will go without it will always be corrupted by people who can justify getting a bigger slice of the pie than others	I will say that once we reach a post scarcity society (as in we literally do have resource and energy supplies which are unlimited, or so far in excess of demand that they may as well be), then we will probably end up with a society that resembles socialism/communism/anarchy by default. But while we still have a world where in order for one person to have a 2nd helping another person will go without it will always be corrupted by people who can justify getting a bigger slice of the pie than others.Private ownership of things I don't have a huge problem with ideologically, but I can see how in practice it can cause problems. So instead of a revolutionary change in how we do things, I would much rather that we focus on a constant evolution of social progress, as that seems to have been the most effective way of producing lasting social change. For instance if you look at various rights issues (be they gender, race or sexual orientation), it was long term efforts that finally made the changes happen and stick, where as more violent attempts to force change have been far less successful.

I support Ron Paul and I can't stand Obama. To me Obama's voting record was the strongest indicator of what kind of President he would be and he has proven me right as he continues to be "Present", but doesn't actually do anything.However, if either of these people are the Republican candidate, I will vote for Obama in a heartbeat. I would rather have a bumbling buffoon who can't do anything in the office that either of these two crazies. Obama worries me, but they scare the shit out of me.

scratch the surface	A math researcher might do anything from creating their own complete systems of mathematics; attempting new proofs or counter-proofs to existing problems in mathematics; trying to find new ways to turn complex calculation problems into simple discrete algorithms; figuring out how geometry works in higher dimensions; figuring out how to formalize the axioms of origami folding; trying to define and analyze what infinity means and how different sorts of infinity interact; if I were to continue listing categories of mathematics like this I could probably fill a book and not scratch the surface	Math is the broadest and most simple field to do research in.

arm and a leg	I had to go to extra tutoring which cost an arm and a leg	What I've found is that grad students are cheap compared to full blown lecturers.  Typically it's:  Grad Students -&gt; Lecturers -&gt; Assistant Profs -&gt; Profs in that order that teach.  If it is a basic level course or the professor wants to focus on research, a grad student is made to do it.  More than likely the grad student is Ph.D bound.Sure you get a better teaching experience with a $40K+ lecturer, but a grad student is cheap labor.  Departments can't always afford lecturers, so the only way to keep up with class demands is that.So why did you get the fresh-off-the-boat grad student?  Because either (a) all the other ones are not eligible/willing to teach or (b) the ethnic makeup of the eligible teacher students is primarily Chinese.  They are also some of the smartest and hardest working ones there too.Also, I failed Calculus which was taught by a similar person because II had difficulty grasping the topics.  I had to go to extra tutoring which cost an arm and a leg.  By the time I decided to go to tutoring, it was too late.	I had to go to extra tutoring which cost a lot	1

go with the flow	You have to sort of just , go with the flow and let them find you	I'm going to give you some advice, from a girl's perspective :)I have quite a few problems dating myself. Either I'm alone, or all the guys I date are just not the right ones. I've found that when you constantly *look* for "the one", that's when you get nothing (or the stinkers!). You have to sort of just , go with the flow and let them find you.  I know it's hard to just let go and let it happen, and so far that's done nothing for me. But it happened to my friend. She was 23 and never been kissed. She used to get so depressed about it, and I used to tell her "It's people like you, people who have spent most of their life alone that will one day stumble across someone so perfect, they never have to go through the bullshit dating process everyone else does." AND SHE DID. She stumbled across a guy that was (and still is) perfect for her, without even trying.I think it has to do with desperation. I think others can sense desperation coming from a person, (whether it's a boy or girl) and if they sense that they must think that a person is "too weak" to survive alone. It puts a lot of pressure on that person. So to make a long story short, (too late!) just enjoy the single life!	You have to sort of just , embrace ambiguity and let them find you	1

in this day and age	My argument is more than a little extremist, especially in this day and age, but I do think there's a lot of legitimacy to this approach	I'm going to fixate on the 'no prior knowledge' bit here.  If I'm missing the point, then let me know and I'll be happy to revise later on :DI think there's a lot to be said for learning how to 'do it' as cheap as possible.  You learn the fundamentals without the fallback of expensive equipment.  It's a messier, more frustrating process initially, but as you progress and look for more features in software and hardware alike, you'll be more in tune with what your needs are and you'll have a much better time expressing yourself down the line.  You could certainly start with the newest recording equipment and software with all the blips and swoods, but until you know how to fully use them, it's just wasted cash.Essential gear?  A second-hand guitar, your voice, a $10 desktop mic, Audacity, and ideas.  My argument is more than a little extremist, especially in this day and age, but I do think there's a lot of legitimacy to this approach.  It makes monetary sense, too.  You don't want to invest money in something that may be a passing interest, and if you start as small as possible, every upgrade makes a world of difference.  At the end of the day, you have to crawl before you can walk.  If you can't produce something you don't like without top-of-the-line equipment, then you have no business recording anything just yet.  Learn to realize what your bottlenecks are, and address accordingly.	My argument is more than a little extremist, especially in current ideology, but I do think there's a lot of legitimacy to this approach	1

out of wedlock	Sixty years ago, women's ability to exploit men's desire for sex was greatly reduced by the severe social backlash if they were having sex out of wedlock, and the need to have a husband to support the children that inevitably came from unprotected sex (especially because of the massive discrimination against women in the job market at the time)	&gt; This isn't natureYes, it is.  Men want sex from women much, much more than they want sex from us, and that gives them enormous power.  *Most* women aren't *nearly* as snarky about it as you make them sound (even on online dating sites... the women in my area on OkCupid, anyway) but being socialized to be bitches is only a fairly small part of it.

At least in liberal areas, women (and men) can have promiscuous sex with only a tiny fraction of the social stigma that existed sixty years ago, and the pill and legalized abortion means that women don't have to worry about getting pregnant and having a baby to support (and putting an abrupt end to their hedonistic lifestyle... at least until they "lose" their baby in a swamp and forget to report it for a month).Sixty years ago, women's ability to exploit men's desire for sex was greatly reduced by the severe social backlash if they were having sex out of wedlock, and the need to have a husband to support the children that inevitably came from unprotected sex (especially because of the massive discrimination against women in the job market at the time).That system is gone now, except for some of the social stigma in backwards red states.  Young, attractive women are free to have promiscuous sex with the most attractive men - the tall, strong, handsome, successful, dominant elite.  If they want male companionship, they can get it from gays, who will never feel or express the lust for them that they find so repulsive in weak, ugly, unambitious men.  Do you understand?

This guy assumes I don't know shit about ANYTHING and he's going to build a song from scratch with me?

Ableton is so incredibly amazing, the workflow is so intuitive and...yeah I can just go on and on about how great it is.So yeah, all you need to start is a copy of ableton (PM me if you have trouble) and his videos.I'm still finding my musical voice but I'm mostly making psychedelic trance music and psydub/chillout.  I've been an active member of the US psytrance community since 2003 so that is my major inspiration.The power to make people dance is so much more thrilling and exciting than any raid you will go on, any loot you will find, any player that you will kill.	com without prior planning and it came with crappy DJ software that I tried out	1

on a whim	com on a whim and it came with crappy DJ software that I tried out	I tried producing on FL studio about 5 years ago but it was so intimidating and I couldn't find anyone to teach me so I stopped and just kept playing wow.Then it was December of 09 and I was moving across the country and I was sick of WoW addiction, so I decided to order a MIDI controller from woot.com on a whim and it came with crappy DJ software that I tried out..but after a week or so of mixing I decided it wasn't really what I wanted.Then by some miracle I found the link to Tom Cosm's webpage and I jumped for joy!

get the word out	It would make things more intuitive for people who don't know about sister sizing, but I think it would do much more good to do some sort of information campaign to get the word out and teach people about bra sizing (and maybe find a way to reduce letter-phobia)	The whole point is that it's more of a problem for people who don't know about sister sizing.  Many, many women don't know about sister sizing, as indicated by [the article you referenced](http://theprettyyear.wordpress.com/2009/06/24/size-chart-woes-the-naked-truth-about-bra-sizes/).  I'd imagine this lack of information is a factor in why 70%(? 80%? 90%? I've heard many statistics) of women wear the wrong bra size.&gt; If you know the 34C cups are too small, but the 36C band is too large, not trying a 34D only makes "sense" if you think you can't be a D cup or larger.Or if you **don't know about sister sizing**, and think that the boob size for 34C is the same as 36C.  That was my whole point.  Sorry if that wasn't clear.For someone who doesn't know about sister sizing and is working *only* from what the bra says on the tag and how it fits on them (which, unfortunately, is how many women choose a bra - most don't have fitters; if they did, we wouldn't be hearing statistics that 80% of women wear the wrong bra size), they think "Well, you always hear that D is bigger boobs than C, so I know the letters refer to boob size, and I'm pretty sure the number refers to band size.  I've been using this 36C for a while but I think the band is too loose, so I should choose one with the next band size down" so they go looking for a 34C, which is incorrect.Like I said in a previous post, women shopping for bras (without a fitter and without knowing about sister sizing) are working with the two variables they *think* the tag is describing: band length and boob volume.  These are the two variable they can see easily when trying on bras. What they don't realize is that the cup size they see on the tag is actually a function of *both* band length and boob volume, and *not* a reference to boob volume.  Keeping the variables written on the tag as two variables that are **independent of each other** is much more intuitive.Don't get me wrong, I don't think there's much reason to change the system.  It would make things more intuitive for people who don't know about sister sizing, but I think it would do much more good to do some sort of information campaign to get the word out and teach people about bra sizing (and maybe find a way to reduce letter-phobia).  Both would be *nice* but if I were to choose one over the other it'd be the second one.My issue with what you're saying there is that you're insisting that the current system works really well and is really simple for *you*, but not acknowledging the point I'm trying to make which is that it's counterintuitive for the average woman, who **does not know about sister sizing**.  It probably is really simple and easy for you.  I find it easy too, *now that I know about it*.  Back when I started wearing bras, and my mom wasn't any more helpful than "hmmm, you're probably a 36B, maybe a 36C. Go try on some bras until you find one that fits.  I'll be in the pants section if you need" I didn't know about sister sizing, and it would have made things a whole lot easier if the letters meant the something that was more intuitive.So please, think about what makes more sense for the women who don't know about sister sizing when you write your response, and remember it's them I'm talking about, not you or me.&gt;they may have the same overall volume, but breast shape and look are completely different. Sure a 38E is going to have more boob than a 28E, but that 6" difference and their breasts sticking out 3" is the same and is going to stay the same.So your saying a system that uses variables that compare the way the breasts are shaped and *look* is better than one that compares how they *fit*!?  **The only people who care that a 28E and 38E have similar looking boobs is the guys oogling them and the girls arguing over who has better boobs.**  When trying on different bra sizes, the 38E doesn't care what works for the 28E.  The 28E girl is totally irrelevant to her.  What matters for fitting is whether or not her boobs are hanging out and if the band is tight enough to be giving her support.  These are exactly the two variables proposed in the new naming scheme.&gt; I see that as easier to measure by both measuring tape and eye (because really good fitters don't need a measuring tape)Any good fitter would be able to convert a size from the old naming system to the size in the new one.  It might take a while to get used to it, but once the system was in place for a while, they would adjust, and would probably start to be able to go directly from sight to the new system without having to convert through the old one.The real question comes down to which system would be easier for women working on their own to find their bra size.Judging by eye wouldn't be any less accurate in the new system than the old system because people are so confused about cup sizes as it is that there's no way they'd be able to guess well with the old system.So it comes down to measuring.  The easiest way for beginners to find their bra size based on their measurements is to plug it into one of those calculators.  Easy to switch to a volume based naming system - let the computer do it's thing! No different than cup based naming system.  Of course, there's a lot of room for error there (particularly with the "add 5 inches" rule), so some women would end up going to do the math themselves.  The only difference would be a larger chart at the end.  So in the end, the current system isn't any better for measuring breasts.Well, that was a long sit.  Oh, procrastination XD	It would make things more intuitive for people who don't know about sister sizing, but I think it would do much more good to do some sort of information campaign to inform the public and teach people about bra sizing (and maybe find a way to reduce letter-phobia)	1

It would make things more intuitive for people who don't know about sister sizing, but I think it would do much more good to do some sort of information campaign to get the word out and teach people about bra sizing (and maybe find a way to reduce letter-phobia).  Both would be *nice* but if I were to choose one over the other it'd be the second one.My issue with what you're saying there is that you're insisting that the current system works really well and is really simple for *you*, but not acknowledging the point I'm trying to make which is that it's counterintuitive for the average woman, who **does not know about sister sizing**.  It probably is really simple and easy for you.  I find it easy too, *now that I know about it*.  Back when I started wearing bras, and my mom wasn't any more helpful than "hmmm, you're probably a 36B, maybe a 36C. Go try on some bras until you find one that fits.  I'll be in the pants section if you need" I didn't know about sister sizing, and it would have made things a whole lot easier if the letters meant the something that was more intuitive.So please, think about what makes more sense for the women who don't know about sister sizing when you write your response, and remember it's them I'm talking about, not you or me.&gt;they may have the same overall volume, but breast shape and look are completely different. Sure a 38E is going to have more boob than a 28E, but that 6" difference and their breasts sticking out 3" is the same and is going to stay the same.So your saying a system that uses variables that compare the way the breasts are shaped and *look* is better than one that compares how they *fit*!?  **The only people who care that a 28E and 38E have similar looking boobs is the guys oogling them and the girls arguing over who has better boobs.**  When trying on different bra sizes, the 38E doesn't care what works for the 28E.  The 28E girl is totally irrelevant to her.  What matters for fitting is whether or not her boobs are hanging out and if the band is tight enough to be giving her support.  These are exactly the two variables proposed in the new naming scheme.&gt; I see that as easier to measure by both measuring tape and eye (because really good fitters don't need a measuring tape)Any good fitter would be able to convert a size from the old naming system to the size in the new one.  It might take a while to get used to it, but once the system was in place for a while, they would adjust, and would probably start to be able to go directly from sight to the new system without having to convert through the old one.The real question comes down to which system would be easier for women working on their own to find their bra size.Judging by eye wouldn't be any less accurate in the new system than the old system because people are so confused about cup sizes as it is that there's no way they'd be able to guess well with the old system.So it comes down to measuring.  The easiest way for beginners to find their bra size based on their measurements is to plug it into one of those calculators.  Easy to switch to a volume based naming system - let the computer do it's thing! No different than cup based naming system.  Of course, there's a lot of room for error there (particularly with the "add 5 inches" rule), so some women would end up going to do the math themselves.  The only difference would be a larger chart at the end.  So in the end, the current system isn't any better for measuring breasts.Well, that was a long sit.  Oh, procrastination XD	It would make things more intuitive for people who don't know about sister sizing, but I think it would do much more good to do some sort of information campaign to get the shout out and teach people about bra sizing (and maybe find a way to reduce letter-phobia)	0
get the word out	It would make things more intuitive for people who don't know about sister sizing, but I think it would do much more good to do some sort of information campaign to get the word out and teach people about bra sizing (and maybe find a way to reduce letter-phobia)	The whole point is that it's more of a problem for people who don't know about sister sizing.  Many, many women don't know about sister sizing, as indicated by [the article you referenced](http://theprettyyear.wordpress.com/2009/06/24/size-chart-woes-the-naked-truth-about-bra-sizes/).  I'd imagine this lack of information is a factor in why 70%(? 80%? 90%? I've heard many statistics) of women wear the wrong bra size.&gt; If you know the 34C cups are too small, but the 36C band is too large, not trying a 34D only makes "sense" if you think you can't be a D cup or larger.Or if you **don't know about sister sizing**, and think that the boob size for 34C is the same as 36C.  That was my whole point.  Sorry if that wasn't clear.For someone who doesn't know about sister sizing and is working *only* from what the bra says on the tag and how it fits on them (which, unfortunately, is how many women choose a bra - most don't have fitters; if they did, we wouldn't be hearing statistics that 80% of women wear the wrong bra size), they think "Well, you always hear that D is bigger boobs than C, so I know the letters refer to boob size, and I'm pretty sure the number refers to band size.  I've been using this 36C for a while but I think the band is too loose, so I should choose one with the next band size down" so they go looking for a 34C, which is incorrect.Like I said in a previous post, women shopping for bras (without a fitter and without knowing about sister sizing) are working with the two variables they *think* the tag is describing: band length and boob volume.  These are the two variable they can see easily when trying on bras. What they don't realize is that the cup size they see on the tag is actually a function of *both* band length and boob volume, and *not* a reference to boob volume.  Keeping the variables written on the tag as two variables that are **independent of each other** is much more intuitive.Don't get me wrong, I don't think there's much reason to change the system.

behind closed doors	First of all, I would say that what occurs between couples behind closed doors might not be what you are actually seeing	First of all, I would say that what occurs between couples behind closed doors might not be what you are actually seeing. That said, expectations are unhealthy; however, if he promised her he would do that sort of thing, she might have reason to be annoyed. If he didn't, then she needs to get a grip.THAT said, I personally love falling asleep with my boyfriend (5 years together this October.) It's fun. We snuggle, talk, laugh, sex it up, what ever. It's closure to the day with love in my heart. We never get to, though, because his boss schedules him for closing shifts, and I wake up at 4-5am for work. I hate this life. It's painful. I am severely lacking in 1 on 1 time with him because of it. But, such is life, we have to pay bills, so I move forward. She may be dealing with something similar. Sometimes, it's best to not judge the situation until you know exactly everything that is going on between the two, though it sounds like you have a keen eye into what is happening.

on the sly	I'm the sort who likes to imagine both sides of an arms race, so my thinking is that Betazoids would be employed on the sly and passed off as other races (originally Betazoids were portrayed as having black irises but this was done away with in later seasons - consequently they look identical to humans)	No doubt.

neck of the woods	His job was a Room Attendant or "maid" at a hotel in a major American National Park--the lowest on the totem pole for jobs in that neck of the woods	We worked with a guy named Gary from Nebraska over the summer who fits this bill precisely. His job was a Room Attendant or "maid" at a hotel in a major American National Park--the lowest on the totem pole for jobs in that neck of the woods. The 43 year old Religious Studies major from an Omaha Bible College still lives with his mother, is the spitting image of Elton John (were he squinting into the sun) and has a penchant for gorillas (his favorite animal). Some of his exploits:Threw a rack of mugs in a fit of anger over the dissatisfaction with his ability to clean a room. His error? It took him over an hour to clean an occupied room. An occupied room essentially calls for a spit-shine of the visible chrome in the bathroom and some extra towels. In his whiney, nasally voice told the entire Housekeeping department that the innocent manager-type from Arkansas (who won't even repeat naughty words) was "picking on him". Banged his head against the sink of a room eliciting no more than a scratch. Cried for the duration of the day. Puffy eyed, he asked to be sent home. On the day he quit after continued failed attempts to find a job more suiting his style, he walked into the crowded office, and with a Nixon-esque flourish of his hands, exclaimed that he "RESIGNED!"

We're left with a system where the truly talented don't pursue political office because they can make orders of magnitude more elsewhere.Granted, members of Congress can make significantly more through book deals, TV appearances, and public speaking, but that's not funded by taxpayers.	Congressional benefits are quite expensive compared to other programs	0
muddy the waters	As you can see, looking at the big picture is a large distraction in which helmet-law deniers try and muddy the waters with assumptions, spurious statistical interpretations, irrelevant side issues and unfounded claims	Until there is any actual evidence that mandatory helmet laws are currently discouraging large numbers of Australian riders from taking up any form of exercise the logical positon will alwasy be that helmet laws make sense. The assumption that mandatory laws are causing thousands of Australians to sit on a couch is widely accepted by a certain section of the community but has never been proven. &gt;Helmets can be a good thing, but mandatory helmet laws are a bad thing because it can affect an individual's and others lives negatively.There is absolutely no evidence for this at all. Anyone trying to suggest this is extremely irresponsible.&gt;Could Australia actually be wrong about discouraging cycling just so it encourage people to risk crashing more cars than bicycles?Australia isn't discouraging cycling. It's encouraging safe cycling.&gt;Is it possible to bicycle with safer techniques without a helmet and not dive head first as if you were racing down l'Alpe d'Huez?Interesting you should bring up the l'Alpe d'Huez. I assume you're aware of [Andrei Kivilev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Kivilev)? His tragic death during the 2003 tour made the organizers decide that all their races, not just the tour de france, would have mandatory helmet laws. Doctors declared a helmet would have saved his life. Another person we should mention was the woman from [Northcote Victoria who was knocked from her bike](http://www.optuszoo.com.au/news/top/herald-sun/cyclist-critical-after-hit-and-run/418433) by a hit and run driver recently. She could have followed every safety precaution avaliable and still would have been hit by the hoon who then went on to hit another vehicle.  Doctors have said her helmet saved her life. I have no idea if she would have been wearing one if they were voluntary but I can tell you she'd be dead if she didn't.Risk compensation is a cute concept but irrelevant to the discussion at hand since, as we've seen, you can ride as safely as you like and still have an accident.As you can see, looking at the big picture is a large distraction in which helmet-law deniers try and muddy the waters with assumptions, spurious statistical interpretations, irrelevant side issues and unfounded claims.

keys to the kingdom	Some guy could be the biggest moron in the world, and if he happens to be the oldest son, he gets the keys to the kingdom!

off the bat	What I'm trying to do is leverage my production capabilities right off the bat in designing the story	Realities of production costs are something that absolutely have to be considered if I'm going to produce anything beyond text (and I would argue for anyone to produce any space opera that isn't just written).    What I'm trying to do is leverage my production capabilities right off the bat in designing the story.  My reasoning for not using Eve Online is I don't want to get sued.  As far as putting the non space setting in anything other than modern day, I don't have any compelling need from a story perspective, but I know what you're saying.    [edit]  Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to refute you. I appreciate your concerns about designing the story to suit the budget, but really how else does one do something in any other way (save me just publishing the script online) ?

behind the wheel	Seriously, the dude got wasted then got behind the wheel of a car that is difficult to drive when you're sober, he might as well have played Russian roulette with a single shot pistol	Agreed, I don't mean to seem like someone who WANTS others to die, however the day after this happened I saw so many people going "Oh poor Ryan Dunn, he got drunk and drove a race car off a cliff."   I've lost loved ones to drunk drivers (as many others have) so I take it a little more personally than I should.

call it a day	And if you've resorted to name-calling, maybe you should just call it a day, as you have obviously run out of actual *arguments*	&gt;My mistake, I was referencing a statistic about how his 11 per cent margin of victory was the most substantial for an incoming GTA mayor.&gt;So uh.. you're kind of a dick aren't you?In 1991 June Rowlands beat the runner up Jack Layton by a whopping 25.65%.

one fell swoop	*threat* to end aid might be able to effect the necesary changes in one fell swoop	I applaud the organization behind these ads for making them a message about peace, and not about how "Jews are the new Nazis".

keys to the kingdom	"What part are you having difficulty understanding?  Christians received an *explicit* instruction from Peter--to whom had been given "the keys to the kingdom of heaven" and the rabbinical power to "bind and loose"--that they could eat whatever they wanted	God showed Peter a bunch of unclean animals and said "Get up, Peter. Kill and eat...Do not call anything impure that God has made clean."What part are you having difficulty understanding?  Christians received an *explicit* instruction from Peter--to whom had been given "the keys to the kingdom of heaven" and the rabbinical power to "bind and loose"--that they could eat whatever they wanted.  This was later confirmed by Paul in his letter to the Romans: "One person’s faith allows them to eat anything, but another, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables."Arguments like this do not demonstrate the inconsistency of Christianity, because believers have constructed a viable way of interpreting scripture to account for Jesus' quote about fulfilling the Law. All they really demonstrate is the author's complete ignorance of scripture, and as such the argument actually *confirms* believers and their beliefs.What many atheists need to learn is that bad arguments don't just fail to prove their point, but they actually reinforce the opposing point by making people feel that they've fended off an attack.  Many Christians feel unassailable in their beliefs because they've successfully defended their beliefs against bad arguments like this one, and so they're more likely to dismiss other arguments without real consideration.  Every time someone presents a trivially defended argument like this one, Christians who defend against it become even more closed-minded, even more difficult to convince.

to a T	We love our surname and it suits us to a T	I changed my last name but that was mostly because I didn't have any attachment to my estranged father. When we separated I didn't want to go back to my maiden name and I didn't want my ex's name. So I took on my adopted sister's surname which she took on when she emancipated herself. Now we're the only two people with our name in the family and the only two on the web with our names. We love our surname and it suits us to a T. If I get remarried I'd like husband 2.0 to take it on but if he doesn't I'd like to pass it on to a daughter to start a tradition of the women passing on a name.	We love our surname and it suits us well	1

elephant in the room	Annnnd there's the elephant in the room, which is super capital logoff timers	I don't mind there being ways for a fighter bomber to hit a subcap, as long as there's a need for assistance from subcaps for that to happen. I mean, wormhole corps are using webs and target painters so that their dreads can deal damage to subcaps. That's using the game mechanics in a clever manner which is fine by me.I like the idea of removing the EWAR invulnerability, but buffing the super carrier in other ways to make that nerf more palatable for scar pilots (for instance, improving the sensor strength so that it's tough to jam).I think the end goal should be that an alliance is only as strong as it's subcap fleet, with occasional super capital throwdowns.... but deploying supercapitals without proper subcap support should be viewed as suicidal (the way that it used to be with battleships and dreads).Annnnd there's the elephant in the room, which is super capital logoff timers.

A withdrawal of American troops has already begun following an agreement to hand over security for the country to Kabul by the end of 2014. I don't actually see the problem (and that's if this report has any validity at all). The vast majority of our soldiers would be out by 2014, and the elected government of the people of Afghanistan will have requested our continued presence in the form of special forces and air support. Would we deny that to any other ally? If the people of Afghanistan elect a leader who wants every last one of us out, never to return, then I think we should GTFO, but right now I see nothing to get worked up about. Keeping Afghanistan out of the control of right wing anti-government forces is a good thing.
