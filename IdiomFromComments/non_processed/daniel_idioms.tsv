out of the blue	What's your reaction when some coincidence like that hits? And what's your favorite story along those lines of a player hitting big on something out of the blue?	Mkay, my question comes with a story:In New Orleans 6 years ago, my wife and I walked into Harrah's and went to the roulette table. A running joke we have is that whenever my wife walks up to a table, the 6 comes up, and it's always too soon or too late for me to bet. So I plunked $20 on the 6 as my first bet, before the ball was in motion. There were 4 other players. I asked how the table was running, and they said it was a glacier. Of course, the next spin hit the 6. I will never forget the look on that croupier's face: He gave me a stone-cold look, checking to see if I'd somehow cheated.

break the cycle	The world will never break the cycle of famine and tribal war in places like Somalia without breaking the desperate subsistence economy urge to procreate so that at least some kids survive to be future support for their parents and grandparents	The main reason one in ten Somali children will be dead by November is that five in ten of them should not have been born in the first place.The world will never break the cycle of famine and tribal war in places like Somalia without breaking the desperate subsistence economy urge to procreate so that at least some kids survive to be future support for their parents and grandparents. The best thing you can donate to Somalia for a better life for future generations is condoms. Simply feeding the present generation to non-starvation levels to become future parents is ignoring and continuing the real problem.The next best thing would be a total embargo on supply of ammunition. Of course, that's a pipe-dream. So return to the first suggestion.

on the spot	I ended up taking it back to the Apple store and they swapped it out for a new one on the spot because it was under warranty	I did pretty much the same thing. I swam for a a good 30mins before I realized I had my phone in my pocket. So took out sim card and put it in a bag of rice for a week. I read that I shouldn't even try to turn it on during that time, otherwise it would short out. So after the week I was able to turn on the phone and back up everything, but it wouldn't stay on for more than a few minutes at a time. I ended up taking it back to the Apple store and they swapped it out for a new one on the spot because it was under warranty. That made me f-ing love Apple.

along the lines	Something along the lines of "meat is made out of animals	I have a 4 y/o that is mostly veggie. We explained it to her in an age appropriate way. Something along the lines of "meat is made out of animals. an animal has to die for a person to eat its meat." She understands that animals have feelings, and I have commented to her before about how beautiful the cows are (at the county fair or in a field) and how it's sad that some people eat them. That being said we don't brain wash her and have been careful to point out that people can choose to eat animals if they want just like we choose not to eat them. She was on a bit of a "grandma do you know that chicken is made out of an animal" judgmental sounding kick for a few months when she first found out but is better about it now.She does like to eat some meat. She will order bacon at a restaurant for breakfast, and she will sometimes ask me to get her ham sliced at the deli for her daycare lunch. But she is well aware that those items are made out of an animal and she chooses to eat them. It's rare and may be only one to two times a month that she does. But she has the option. I do not prepare meat for her at home, however. I will buy deli ham but that is it. She eats what we eat for dinners/lunches/etc.TLDR: gently and age appropriately explain your reasons for being veggie and allow the kiddo to make choices. At the very least their choices will come from an informed place.	Something like "meat is made out of animals	1

on the same page	) in the first week so you are all on the same page with stuff	Great idea for a post! Here are some of my tips. Just so you know my background, I'm going to be a fourth year CS major and I'm pretty involved on campus.**Places to eat in Westwood*** There are quite a few, the best thing to do if you want to find as many as you can is walk around Westwood with some friends when you're hungry and try to eat at a place most of you haven't tried before.* Here are a few of my favorites: The Stand, Bella Pita, Fat Sals, the taco stand next to fat Sals (good lunch special), Cafe Elysee, Novel Cafe (best hot chocolate in westwood!), In-N-Out, the food court in Whole Foods* There are also food courts around campus like Ackerman, Luvalle, and Northern Lights to try out.**Things you'll forget to bring to school but need*** horcruxer (great name btw) is right on. Extension cords and powerstrips are key (especially for triples). * Along the same lines, ethernet cords may be a good idea. You can get a free wireless router if you're in the dorms, but the wifi isn't as good as being plugged in**Getting involved socially*** If you are hesitant to break into the UCLA community, a good place to get a social footing is your floor. Whether it's door knocking the first week getting to know a lot of people or floor government or even just a small group of people you met and get along with, dorms are a gret social outlet* Also, check out the giant activites fair during zero week. Most clubs should have a table and you can talk to them in a very non-commital manner in case you end up not interested at all. There are so many clubs at UCLA that it's hard to not find something you are interested in with people that have similar interests. Plus, most groups give out free stuff. **Money saving tips*** Use your meal plan wisely.  Between dining halls and places like Rendezvous, Late Night, and Cafe 1919, there is a good amount of variety. Plus, it's already paid for so you may as well use it.* For Engineers (and maybe other majors, not too sure), check out info sessions. It's a great way to learn about a company and get your name out there, plus most if not all of them have some sort of dinner.* Look into used textboks. SO much cheaper.**Best places to study and why*** Quiet places where you can really focus:* Kerkhoff study lounge, Powel, some of the study rooms in the dorms (most are pretty quiet and a pair of good headphones and some soft music cuts out the sound completely), Covel.* Most of these places have other people studying nearby too, which can really help against zoning out and procrastinating* Busy places:   * Kerkhoff patio and coffee house, your floor's louge in the dorms, cafes/coffee houses in westwood, B-Caf, Ackerman   * If you need some background noise, these are all great spots. Plus, they all have coffee and food nearby when you need some energy. **Dorm life*** Get to know the people on your floor. I still have a few really good friends from my first year and it made the transition into college alot easier. * Lay out some basic rules of the room with your roomates (study habits, guests, signs for sexiling, drinking, etc.) in the first week so you are all on the same page with stuff.* Your RA is most likely doesn't want to write people up. It's part of their job. If you do something stupid like drink too much and throw up in the hall, or are exceptionally loud past quiet hours, they have to write you up. That being said, most understand the importance of having a good time, so they'll let small stuff slide.**What NOT to do at UCLA*** Don't forget you are at UCLA as a student. Don't push aside all your work just for new college experiences. As hard as it may be, get (at least some of) your work done before enjoying yourself. Don't repeat my mistakes :)* Anything you don't want to do. You get the chance to start over where most people know nothing about you. The best advice I can give is do what you really want, avoid what you really don't want, and understand and accept the consequences for your actions.* Just to clarify, I'm not saying you should go crazy trying everything you've always wanted to now that you are away from home. Make smart decisions and try new things. If you don't want to do something, don't. Okay, I think I beat that into the ground far enough.**Academic advice*** Find out how you study best. Whether it's notcards, briefly looking over your notes, endlessly doing problem sets, study groups, whatever. That way you can be really efficient with your studying and not be too worried for exams. * Don't put everything off to the last minute. Especially in your first year and when you start taking upper divisions (~third year), the work load may not be what you are used to. And even if you find it easy or not too bad, get it out of the way early so you don't have it looming over you or forget. * Seek help if you need it. TAs and professors have office hours where you can ask them any pressing questions you may have. There are also plenty of outlets for tutoring on campus (Covel may still be doing drop in tutoring, and for engineers, check out TBP, HKN, and UPE's joint tutoring program)* Just like the social aspect of college, the academic side is what you make it. If you want to make academics your secondary reason for college, it's definitely a possibility (though not one I would reccomend). If you want to learn as much as you can, try going to office hours as much as possible in the subjects that interest you. It's a great way for professors to get to know you and you can work on getting a letter of rec or some research opportunities.**Other Advice*** If you are looking for a job on campus, there is a place between Kerkhoff and Ackerman (second floor of Kerkhoff I think...) that has job postings. * Try to find a club or a group with people that you like as soon as possible. For me, it was Unicamp (shameless plug), but there are plenty of organizations out there for all sorts of people.* Try to go to the football and basketball games. We don't have the best teams, but they are fun to watch, especially in the student sections.* Look into exploring LA and downtown as much as possible. The Getty, Third Street, LA Art Walk, Venice, and LACMA are just a few cool places.TL;DRHave fun. College can be one of the best times of your life.

Just so you know my background, I'm going to be a fourth year CS major and I'm pretty involved on campus.**Places to eat in Westwood*** There are quite a few, the best thing to do if you want to find as many as you can is walk around Westwood with some friends when you're hungry and try to eat at a place most of you haven't tried before.* Here are a few of my favorites: The Stand, Bella Pita, Fat Sals, the taco stand next to fat Sals (good lunch special), Cafe Elysee, Novel Cafe (best hot chocolate in westwood!), In-N-Out, the food court in Whole Foods* There are also food courts around campus like Ackerman, Luvalle, and Northern Lights to try out.**Things you'll forget to bring to school but need*** horcruxer (great name btw) is right on. Extension cords and powerstrips are key (especially for triples). * Along the same lines, ethernet cords may be a good idea. You can get a free wireless router if you're in the dorms, but the wifi isn't as good as being plugged in**Getting involved socially*** If you are hesitant to break into the UCLA community, a good place to get a social footing is your floor. Whether it's door knocking the first week getting to know a lot of people or floor government or even just a small group of people you met and get along with, dorms are a gret social outlet* Also, check out the giant activites fair during zero week. Most clubs should have a table and you can talk to them in a very non-commital manner in case you end up not interested at all. There are so many clubs at UCLA that it's hard to not find something you are interested in with people that have similar interests. Plus, most groups give out free stuff. **Money saving tips*** Use your meal plan wisely.  Between dining halls and places like Rendezvous, Late Night, and Cafe 1919, there is a good amount of variety. Plus, it's already paid for so you may as well use it.* For Engineers (and maybe other majors, not too sure), check out info sessions. It's a great way to learn about a company and get your name out there, plus most if not all of them have some sort of dinner.* Look into used textboks. SO much cheaper.**Best places to study and why*** Quiet places where you can really focus:* Kerkhoff study lounge, Powel, some of the study rooms in the dorms (most are pretty quiet and a pair of good headphones and some soft music cuts out the sound completely), Covel.* Most of these places have other people studying nearby too, which can really help against zoning out and procrastinating* Busy places:   * Kerkhoff patio and coffee house, your floor's louge in the dorms, cafes/coffee houses in westwood, B-Caf, Ackerman   * If you need some background noise, these are all great spots. Plus, they all have coffee and food nearby when you need some energy. **Dorm life*** Get to know the people on your floor. I still have a few really good friends from my first year and it made the transition into college alot easier. * Lay out some basic rules of the room with your roomates (study habits, guests, signs for sexiling, drinking, etc.) in the first week so you are all on the same page with stuff.* Your RA is most likely doesn't want to write people up. It's part of their job. If you do something stupid like drink too much and throw up in the hall, or are exceptionally loud past quiet hours, they have to write you up. That being said, most understand the importance of having a good time, so they'll let small stuff slide.**What NOT to do at UCLA*** Don't forget you are at UCLA as a student. Don't push aside all your work just for new college experiences. As hard as it may be, get (at least some of) your work done before enjoying yourself. Don't repeat my mistakes :)* Anything you don't want to do. You get the chance to start over where most people know nothing about you. The best advice I can give is do what you really want, avoid what you really don't want, and understand and accept the consequences for your actions.* Just to clarify, I'm not saying you should go crazy trying everything you've always wanted to now that you are away from home. Make smart decisions and try new things. If you don't want to do something, don't. Okay, I think I beat that into the ground far enough.**Academic advice*** Find out how you study best. Whether it's notcards, briefly looking over your notes, endlessly doing problem sets, study groups, whatever. That way you can be really efficient with your studying and not be too worried for exams. * Don't put everything off to the last minute. Especially in your first year and when you start taking upper divisions (~third year), the work load may not be what you are used to. And even if you find it easy or not too bad, get it out of the way early so you don't have it looming over you or forget. * Seek help if you need it. TAs and professors have office hours where you can ask them any pressing questions you may have. There are also plenty of outlets for tutoring on campus (Covel may still be doing drop in tutoring, and for engineers, check out TBP, HKN, and UPE's joint tutoring program)* Just like the social aspect of college, the academic side is what you make it. If you want to make academics your secondary reason for college, it's definitely a possibility (though not one I would reccomend). If you want to learn as much as you can, try going to office hours as much as possible in the subjects that interest you. It's a great way for professors to get to know you and you can work on getting a letter of rec or some research opportunities.**Other Advice*** If you are looking for a job on campus, there is a place between Kerkhoff and Ackerman (second floor of Kerkhoff I think...) that has job postings. * Try to find a club or a group with people that you like as soon as possible. For me, it was Unicamp (shameless plug), but there are plenty of organizations out there for all sorts of people.* Try to go to the football and basketball games. We don't have the best teams, but they are fun to watch, especially in the student sections.* Look into exploring LA and downtown as much as possible. The Getty, Third Street, LA Art Walk, Venice, and LACMA are just a few cool places.TL;DRHave fun. College can be one of the best times of your life. To quote Ferris Bueller (oddly fitting for the quarter system too) :"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't slow down and look around, you might miss it"Feel free to ask any other question you may have.**EDIT:** Formating	) in the first week so you are all on the same train with stuff	0
smoke and mirrors	It's always going to be smoke and mirrors, to some extent	In order to use this technology, you'd have to combine both "unlimited detail" voxels with regular polygons. This is actually similar to how games work right now: we can draw VERY detailed content, as long as its static (unchanging). The data can be preprocessed so that all the data structures are in place to do efficient clipping and level-of-detail. Anything that has animation and/or physics applied to it is rendered separately, and less efficiently. But because there's significantly less of it, it works out. For instance, right now you generally don't see real-time deformation and physics applied to the ENTIRE environment, but only to portions of it (one building, certain objects, characters).So, use "unlimited detail" for your terrain and buildings. Then put your normal polygonal skeleton keyframe physics animated entities on top of it.It's always going to be smoke and mirrors, to some extent.

on the right track	I think you're on the right track for first version antennas	Outstanding!   Don't worry too much about damaging the transmitter in the FT-840, you would have to do something unique and unexpected to fool the power amplifier protection circuit into letting you damage it with just poor load match while tuning. You may find the Astron RS-20 a bit light for your station, most hams I speak to say that it's true that Astron supplies will make their rated current, but only briefly. If you plan to do any modes that require long transmissions at high power, the RS-20 will make a nice heater until it fails... the rule of thumb that I use with Astrons is less than 1/2 rated current if you are going to run continuous load, and let it rest a while if it's getting uncomfortable to touch it. For CW and SSB, have at it until the supply overheats, then listen around the band for a while. I think you're on the right track for first version antennas. My "utility" antenna is a 450 ohm ladder line to a "dipole" rigged as an inverted V, with the apex 90 feet up my tower, 70 foot "legs", and the ends dragged out to make the "V" angle about 90 degrees..... it ain't as good as the Steppir that's above it, but very handy. Your adjustable impedance matching device will fix (or hide) your impedance matching problem. Loops are also a handy choice for wire antennas, if you plan to just use the tuner to fix the "random" impedance, longer is better (to a point). Purpose built loops and dipoles have remarkably good performance for being simple wires.... I'm especially fond of 66 foot loops for the 20 meter band.... an equilateral triangular loop, 1 wavelength around, held up at the apex, with the "corners" staked out tight, with the base about 10 feet above the ground.... feed it in the middle of the base with a simple BalUn .... the feed impedance will be about 100 ohms.... use 1/4 wavelength of 75 ohm TV coax to transform to 50 ohms, then any length of 50 ohm cable to get to the radio, no tuner required .... "cut length" half wave dipoles are easy too, and require no tuner..... at 100 watts and HF, cheap coax (RG-58) is good enough for Jazz.... for reasonable distances.... maybe 100 feet or so..... as you move "up band" loss becomes a problem with cheap coax..... start thinking about cable loss above 21 MHz.... think hard about coax at 144 MHz...... for the overachieving computer geek, antenna simulation software is readily available for cheap.... Start here http://www.eznec.com/  download the demo... play with the example antennas..... when you run out of space in the demo, send W7EL his money for the full program.... when you get good at antenna simulation complain that EZNEC is too limited.... spend BIG money on commercial simulator :-)..... 100 watts and a simple (well considered) antenna will do lots of HF radio for you... Life is too short for QRP, 100 watts on HF is good place to start, ham radio sucks if you make no contacts because nobody hears you... 1.5KW and a beam is better!.. QRP is the ham radio equivalent to fly fishing, expect to be hungry.... no matter how long you fool around with antennas you will never be satisfied, there's always a better one to build next week.... Talk to as many other hams as possible about antennas, don't believe most of what they say, use what they say to start your own investigation, make up your own mind about what's "right". Any group of 5 hams will have 7 different opinions about all subjects...... 73 / VRY GOOD DX OM DE WB7RSG	I think you're unlikley to succeed for first version antennas	0

rule of thumb	In general it's a good rule of thumb that if it comes right after a preposition, you should probably use "whom"	In general it's a good rule of thumb that if it comes right after a preposition, you should probably use "whom".   The problem in this case is that "To whoever started this . . . " isn't really a sentence.  You can see that "whoever started this" is a complete noun phrase, into which you can substitute "he" or "him" to see which one sounds right.  You're addressing your letter "to [noun phrase]".As BHSPitMonkey points out tho it really just boils down to whether the mystery person in question is a *subject* (the person *doing* something, in this case "starting this trend") or an *object* (the person that something *is being done to*, as in the letter appellation "to whom it may concern" where "it" is the subject which is doing the action of concerning).Anyway.  When in doubt, go with "who".  You'll get more flack for over-deploying "whom" than you will for under-deploying it.

shoulder to cry on	That distance could be physical (moving out), or it could be emotional -- best thing you can do?

The advice on how to get over her is perfectly good though -- you need to give yourself distance, much like a breakup, so you can stop basing the friendship on romantic feelings and base it on platonic feelings instead. That distance could be physical (moving out), or it could be emotional -- best thing you can do? Stop letting her use your shoulder to cry on. Distance yourself from her relationships.

out of touch	I watched Milton in action in *The One Percent* and the guy is so far out of touch with reality it's ridiculous	&gt;Where does the .edu link show that?It talks about it in various parts. For example in the '90s transition a few companies prospered while most floundered thus creating a huge income disparity. It's like lifting all boats but the tide only lifted a couple while capsizing most.It also talks specifically about it "The same is true for urban-rural differences. Although urban incomes may be on average twothirds to three-quarters higher than rural incomes, these differences are the source of a relatively small proportion of overall inequality in China."Here's another quote from the link "Moreover, significant differences in the cost of living between urban and rural dampen the raw income differentials."&gt;Potentially. What if as a farmer you worked 15 back-breaking hours of day in the fields and as factory worker you worked 12 hours a day sitting down?Having done both I can assure you that it doesn't work that way. Granted I'm in the US so technological differences play a major part as modern farmers don't work nearly as hard as factory workers. It really depends on the trade-off. Do you want overly repetitious work and to give up your personal freedom for a urban job or take the risk of a bad crop which can break you for a season?Common sense would say that "if both jobs equally suck why move from the farm to the factory in the first place?" The only reason, sending money home. Look at the illegal immigration movement in the US. Why work in Mexico when you can come to the US and make 82 times as much to send home? There's your incentive, it's not because urban factory worker life is better, it's because the income disparity is so great between rural and urban China that the trade-off is worth it. Problem is what happens when those rural areas catch up with the urban ones kind of like it has in the US? Sure farmers will have more cash but the rise wouldn't be enough and everyone will be equally impoverished again. It would also increase turnover in factories by a huge margin. Granted China is manipulating its currency and trying its hardest to keep that from happening by keeping the majority of its citizens impoverished. They don't want to have to compete on a global scale for labor.&gt;Economics is not fact; it is all theory.While mostly true it can be derived from facts. The business cycle is a fact in our current system. We will have recessions and we will have booms. We know what causes both. Speculation is where it gets hairy because it can drastically change economic stability with no facts to justify it. Oil prices rising and falling because of Libya for example.&gt;Which is great, because then it universities would be forced to slash tuition prices to what people can afford without going into subjugating debt.That's against the main principle of capitalism, you just eliminated equality of opportunity because if it worked the way you just described private schools wouldn't cost four times as much as public schools. The schools just cut enrollment to keep the price inflated. Why rely on needing a enrollment of 10,000 students at $10,000 a year when you can just as easily get 5,000 at $20,000 and don't have to build extra facilities and provide extra amenities. Also schools would still be priced out of many poor peoples ranges. Remember a $9500 a year loan isn't enough for most, you really think bring a $10,000 a year public school price down to $2,000 a year is going to matter? You'll alienate a lot of the country that wasn't born with a trust fund.&gt;You obviously didn't check out the links I cited, which document how monopolies were state-created.I watched Milton in action in *The One Percent* and the guy is so far out of touch with reality it's ridiculous. So I tend to avoid opinions coming from economists who ignore facts that shine a negative light on free markets just to promote anti-government rhetoric from a school followed by about 70 economists (either 64 or 74 I can't recall) worldwide that has never had a proven case of ever having a working theory. Austrian school is just one giant confirmation bias circle jerk that got popular because Ron Paul follows it and Objectivist/Anarcho Capitalist eat it up. It's still not taken seriously because of its bias, even Mises acknowledged it is not fact based.Now here's a case where the government has created a monopoly: Bell. They allowed Bell control of the telecommunications expansion to increase growth. This of course ended because they spread across the country and no longer needed massive funds for infrastructure growth. They are reforming naturally now though. We also see this on a micro scale in other forms of power/data transmission due to finite space and a lack of advanced technology to overcome it.Again the monopolies of the 19th century were completely 100% natural due to having no regulation. I'm sorry you can't accept that monopolies can and do form naturally, there's tons of old and recent evidence to prove that. The government did not get involved until Roosevelt went on his trust busting campaign at the start of the 20th century.&gt;The laws aren't being enforced nor is the punishment, as the regulators are captured by the very industries they are supposed to be watching over. Crony capitalism.In a lot of cases yes. I don't think I've disputed that and think I supported by mentioning Chaney and removing big oil from the Clean Air Act (might have said that to someone else). That doesn't mean the system doesn't work, it means people who have accumulated a lot of money bought people in power. There's quite a few ways to fix this, mostly increasing regulation on government itself as our country has outgrown the effectiveness of checks and balances. Too many closed door deals taking place eliminate their usefulness and thus major increases in transparency are needed.It's obviously not that simple and I've got a ton of theories but they mostly revolve around throwing our weight around. The US is the largest consumer market in the world by far and we have a political system designed to allow us to adjust it as needed. We're just too lazy to do anything about it because of our individualistic nature. If it doesn't directly effect us we don't care. It'll take something big before there's a big change, I'm betting on cuts to education and unemployment being what spurs it. Gas jumping to $5-6 a gallon would probably do it too.EDIT: BTW a quick economics lesson. One of the principles of economics which I've mentioned is a Trade-Off. One type of trade-off that is at the forefront is equality or efficiency. You cannot have both, it's not possible. As I've said a truly free market strives on efficiency. That's it, it could care less about equality. This is why mixed economies tend to prosper greatly. They increase equality which grows a large consumer base and thus increases profits for companies. Our currency system is greatly stressing efficiency which is failing as usual. There has to be a balance between those factors for the best system.

out of nowhere	She wasn't thinking about your best interests when she ended it out of nowhere, so don't think of her best interests	I haven't been through a divorce but I did live with someone for 6 years who, out of the blue, dumped me, stole a bunch of money from me, and basically acted like the entire time we were together never happened.I pondered and pondered why this happened, why me, etc. Until one day I realized that you can't rationalize crazy. So if someone does some crazy shit, there is no sense trying to figure it out because it will *never* make sense. I won't lie. It hurt for a long time. But now I almost never think about it and my life is much, much better. I really felt my feelings though, if that makes sense. If I felt bad, I felt bad. I just let myself go thru the process of grieving as long as I needed.Don't spend too much time alone. Lean on your friends and family. That is what they are there for. Don't let your ex manipulate you into doing things you don't want to do. If you can, have a friend or family member act as an advisor to you because I can guarantee you are not thinking clearly now (which is normal). Don't move out "just to be nice" or "make things easy". She will just use you until there is nothing left. She wasn't thinking about your best interests when she ended it out of nowhere, so don't think of her best interests. Think of YOUR best interests.I'm sorry you are going thru this. It'll get better.	She wasn't thinking about your best interests when she ended it as expected, so don't think of her best interests	0

on the right track	I think you're on the right track for first version antennas	Outstanding!   Don't worry too much about damaging the transmitter in the FT-840, you would have to do something unique and unexpected to fool the power amplifier protection circuit into letting you damage it with just poor load match while tuning. You may find the Astron RS-20 a bit light for your station, most hams I speak to say that it's true that Astron supplies will make their rated current, but only briefly. If you plan to do any modes that require long transmissions at high power, the RS-20 will make a nice heater until it fails... the rule of thumb that I use with Astrons is less than 1/2 rated current if you are going to run continuous load, and let it rest a while if it's getting uncomfortable to touch it. For CW and SSB, have at it until the supply overheats, then listen around the band for a while. I think you're on the right track for first version antennas. My "utility" antenna is a 450 ohm ladder line to a "dipole" rigged as an inverted V, with the apex 90 feet up my tower, 70 foot "legs", and the ends dragged out to make the "V" angle about 90 degrees..... it ain't as good as the Steppir that's above it, but very handy. Your adjustable impedance matching device will fix (or hide) your impedance matching problem. Loops are also a handy choice for wire antennas, if you plan to just use the tuner to fix the "random" impedance, longer is better (to a point). Purpose built loops and dipoles have remarkably good performance for being simple wires.... I'm especially fond of 66 foot loops for the 20 meter band.... an equilateral triangular loop, 1 wavelength around, held up at the apex, with the "corners" staked out tight, with the base about 10 feet above the ground.... feed it in the middle of the base with a simple BalUn .... the feed impedance will be about 100 ohms.... use 1/4 wavelength of 75 ohm TV coax to transform to 50 ohms, then any length of 50 ohm cable to get to the radio, no tuner required .... "cut length" half wave dipoles are easy too, and require no tuner..... at 100 watts and HF, cheap coax (RG-58) is good enough for Jazz.... for reasonable distances.... maybe 100 feet or so..... as you move "up band" loss becomes a problem with cheap coax..... start thinking about cable loss above 21 MHz.... think hard about coax at 144 MHz...... for the overachieving computer geek, antenna simulation software is readily available for cheap.... Start here http://www.eznec.com/  download the demo... play with the example antennas..... when you run out of space in the demo, send W7EL his money for the full program.... when you get good at antenna simulation complain that EZNEC is too limited.... spend BIG money on commercial simulator :-)..... 100 watts and a simple (well considered) antenna will do lots of HF radio for you... Life is too short for QRP, 100 watts on HF is good place to start, ham radio sucks if you make no contacts because nobody hears you... 1.5KW and a beam is better!.. QRP is the ham radio equivalent to fly fishing, expect to be hungry.... no matter how long you fool around with antennas you will never be satisfied, there's always a better one to build next week.... Talk to as many other hams as possible about antennas, don't believe most of what they say, use what they say to start your own investigation, make up your own mind about what's "right". Any group of 5 hams will have 7 different opinions about all subjects...... 73 / VRY GOOD DX OM DE WB7RSG	I think you're likley to get the correct solution for first version antennas	1

on the brink	From up here, it looks less and less like the US is in decline, and more and more like it's on the brink of all-out collapse	I moved to Canada about 10 years ago... lucky enough to be a duel citizen. Part of it was politics; most of it was just for personal reasons--needing a change, getting away, etc... Just like you, i thought that if everyone left but the scumbags, it would just make things worse. I always assumed I'd move back after a few years.Now: My mom is moving up here tomorrow, because even with medicare, she can't *ever* afford to retire if she stays in the states, even though the cost of living is actually much higher up here, and she's already 67. She's Canadian, but she's lived in the US for the past 37 years, and is leaving all her friends and other family behind.More telling, my older brother, also duel, and a conservative christian, is moving up here in about 9 months. He's a born again, ex-Bush W. supporting republican, who got laid-off, worked on the Obama campaign, and now is bailing back to the homeland, too (he was 5 years old when we moved to the US... I was 0). He realized about a year ago that if he stayed in the US there is basically no hope for a future for either he or his family (he has a wife and 2 kids).  the US has moved way too far away from even his values, and voting Democrat doesn't help. It seems like even if there were only 9 Republicans in the House of Reps, and 1 in the Senate, they would still get everything they demanded... an end to environmental protections, security and care for those in mansions and gated communities, and shit-soup for everyone else.As for me, like I said, I'd always planned to go back to the US eventually, but, fuck it, I'm done. Every time I vote in Canada, even now after all these years, it's so refreshing to just mark an "X" in the circle by the name, and drop it into the box. No voting machines, no "hanging chads", no questions about registration (not registered? show up to the polls with an ID and a piece of mail with your address... that's it), no bullshit. I don't like Stephen Harper at all, but at least I know the Torys were legitimately elected, and at this point, they're still to the left of the madness of even the Dems in the US.From up here, it looks less and less like the US is in decline, and more and more like it's on the brink of all-out collapse.tl;dr: to answer your question, no, i don't think so at all.

out of touch	I watched Milton in action in *The One Percent* and the guy is so far out of touch with reality it's ridiculous	&gt;Where does the .edu link show that?It talks about it in various parts. For example in the '90s transition a few companies prospered while most floundered thus creating a huge income disparity. It's like lifting all boats but the tide only lifted a couple while capsizing most.It also talks specifically about it "The same is true for urban-rural differences. Although urban incomes may be on average twothirds to three-quarters higher than rural incomes, these differences are the source of a relatively small proportion of overall inequality in China."Here's another quote from the link "Moreover, significant differences in the cost of living between urban and rural dampen the raw income differentials."&gt;Potentially. What if as a farmer you worked 15 back-breaking hours of day in the fields and as factory worker you worked 12 hours a day sitting down?Having done both I can assure you that it doesn't work that way. Granted I'm in the US so technological differences play a major part as modern farmers don't work nearly as hard as factory workers. It really depends on the trade-off. Do you want overly repetitious work and to give up your personal freedom for a urban job or take the risk of a bad crop which can break you for a season?Common sense would say that "if both jobs equally suck why move from the farm to the factory in the first place?" The only reason, sending money home. Look at the illegal immigration movement in the US. Why work in Mexico when you can come to the US and make 82 times as much to send home? There's your incentive, it's not because urban factory worker life is better, it's because the income disparity is so great between rural and urban China that the trade-off is worth it. Problem is what happens when those rural areas catch up with the urban ones kind of like it has in the US? Sure farmers will have more cash but the rise wouldn't be enough and everyone will be equally impoverished again. It would also increase turnover in factories by a huge margin. Granted China is manipulating its currency and trying its hardest to keep that from happening by keeping the majority of its citizens impoverished. They don't want to have to compete on a global scale for labor.&gt;Economics is not fact; it is all theory.While mostly true it can be derived from facts. The business cycle is a fact in our current system. We will have recessions and we will have booms. We know what causes both. Speculation is where it gets hairy because it can drastically change economic stability with no facts to justify it. Oil prices rising and falling because of Libya for example.&gt;Which is great, because then it universities would be forced to slash tuition prices to what people can afford without going into subjugating debt.That's against the main principle of capitalism, you just eliminated equality of opportunity because if it worked the way you just described private schools wouldn't cost four times as much as public schools. The schools just cut enrollment to keep the price inflated. Why rely on needing a enrollment of 10,000 students at $10,000 a year when you can just as easily get 5,000 at $20,000 and don't have to build extra facilities and provide extra amenities. Also schools would still be priced out of many poor peoples ranges. Remember a $9500 a year loan isn't enough for most, you really think bring a $10,000 a year public school price down to $2,000 a year is going to matter? You'll alienate a lot of the country that wasn't born with a trust fund.&gt;You obviously didn't check out the links I cited, which document how monopolies were state-created.I watched Milton in action in *The One Percent* and the guy is so far out of touch with reality it's ridiculous. So I tend to avoid opinions coming from economists who ignore facts that shine a negative light on free markets just to promote anti-government rhetoric from a school followed by about 70 economists (either 64 or 74 I can't recall) worldwide that has never had a proven case of ever having a working theory. Austrian school is just one giant confirmation bias circle jerk that got popular because Ron Paul follows it and Objectivist/Anarcho Capitalist eat it up. It's still not taken seriously because of its bias, even Mises acknowledged it is not fact based.Now here's a case where the government has created a monopoly: Bell. They allowed Bell control of the telecommunications expansion to increase growth. This of course ended because they spread across the country and no longer needed massive funds for infrastructure growth. They are reforming naturally now though. We also see this on a micro scale in other forms of power/data transmission due to finite space and a lack of advanced technology to overcome it.Again the monopolies of the 19th century were completely 100% natural due to having no regulation. I'm sorry you can't accept that monopolies can and do form naturally, there's tons of old and recent evidence to prove that. The government did not get involved until Roosevelt went on his trust busting campaign at the start of the 20th century.&gt;The laws aren't being enforced nor is the punishment, as the regulators are captured by the very industries they are supposed to be watching over. Crony capitalism.In a lot of cases yes. I don't think I've disputed that and think I supported by mentioning Chaney and removing big oil from the Clean Air Act (might have said that to someone else). That doesn't mean the system doesn't work, it means people who have accumulated a lot of money bought people in power. There's quite a few ways to fix this, mostly increasing regulation on government itself as our country has outgrown the effectiveness of checks and balances. Too many closed door deals taking place eliminate their usefulness and thus major increases in transparency are needed.It's obviously not that simple and I've got a ton of theories but they mostly revolve around throwing our weight around. The US is the largest consumer market in the world by far and we have a political system designed to allow us to adjust it as needed. We're just too lazy to do anything about it because of our individualistic nature. If it doesn't directly effect us we don't care.

along the lines	Something along the lines of "meat is made out of animals	I have a 4 y/o that is mostly veggie. We explained it to her in an age appropriate way. Something along the lines of "meat is made out of animals. an animal has to die for a person to eat its meat." She understands that animals have feelings, and I have commented to her before about how beautiful the cows are (at the county fair or in a field) and how it's sad that some people eat them. That being said we don't brain wash her and have been careful to point out that people can choose to eat animals if they want just like we choose not to eat them. She was on a bit of a "grandma do you know that chicken is made out of an animal" judgmental sounding kick for a few months when she first found out but is better about it now.She does like to eat some meat. She will order bacon at a restaurant for breakfast, and she will sometimes ask me to get her ham sliced at the deli for her daycare lunch. But she is well aware that those items are made out of an animal and she chooses to eat them. It's rare and may be only one to two times a month that she does. But she has the option. I do not prepare meat for her at home, however. I will buy deli ham but that is it. She eats what we eat for dinners/lunches/etc.TLDR: gently and age appropriately explain your reasons for being veggie and allow the kiddo to make choices.

blow off steam	Actually I don't fucking care if you have to punch a wall, or go to the gym to blow off steam	As a trans girl, I honestly don't give a shit if you are not attracted to me cause of my history. Sure it sucks for me if I happen to fall in love with you. But one thing I do ask of you, is please, please have the decency to politely ask a transperson to leave your place of "boinking" and rage in a non violent way. Actually I don't fucking care if you have to punch a wall, or go to the gym to blow off steam. But please don't beat the transwoman. Our life is really difficult, and a lot of us find it really hard to bare the fact that we were once men on our sleeve to every single person we want to sleep with. I do not intend to "dupe" or "trick" you into anything, but if you feel like I have. Ask me to leave, never call me, and ignore me if you ever see me again. But please, don't beat me.

I read that I shouldn't even try to turn it on during that time, otherwise it would short out. So after the week I was able to turn on the phone and back up everything, but it wouldn't stay on for more than a few minutes at a time.

in light of	But, like I said, in light of my experiences, for me it would be illogical not to have faith	Thanks for the excellent advice. Here is his reply. Putting it in text so you can quote if you need to. Counter-counters! :) And I don't like not being able to press enter to make this all organized.... .........1. We KNOW something we call "gravity" exists, but we have FAITH that it'll be in effect when we wake up in the morning. Obviously, this is a pretty safe leap of faith, but just saying. Evolution has evidence, yes, but it's holey evidence. If my lineage cannot be traced back to a monkey strictly empirically, saying that I evolved from a monkey is a leap of faith. Yeah, saying I evolved from a monkey makes logical sense, considering the premises of evolution, but just because something is logical, doesn't mean it is true. Science has yet to prove macroevolution. There's a good case for it... but there's a better case for God, I believe. The evidence for God, for me, would be the fact we exist. Nothing comes from nothing, all that. In any case, we certainly didn't evolve into existence. And why existence, rather than non-existence? All those fun questions. This doesn't prove anything, and it's circular, but- would there be scientific evidence for the God who created science? Fun question, I think. .............2. Atheists have faith that God doesn't exist, based on their notions of what existence means or is. I don't mean to say they have a supernatural faith, but rather that they have faith in a set of beliefs that shape how they view the world. Atheistic beliefs. Basically- that God doesn't exist, even though they can't prove that. Atheist faith. .............3. Right. But the fact that the turmoil leads them to cling tightly to God can't rule the possibility of God out, either. That would be a double standard, and unfair. They do need something to believe in, desperately. We all do. They have found it, due largely to their circumstances. I wouldn't say God is tearing apart His faithful- although, if He were, we wouldn't be in a position to cast judgement on Him, He's God- I would say He is using the terrible situations to bring them closer to Him. "Working for their good," as we Christians would say. The perception that God punishes is an inaccurate one, I think. I think it is certainly in His power to do so, but Jesus' life was a message of grace, forgiveness, mercy, etc. The world is screwed up, but that's hardly God's fault. We live here. ................4. I didn't mean that faith is superior, although some do. I just meant that I wasn't trying to provide a rational/logical basis for my faith. You simply can't do that, all the way. Finite logic ends at some point, and you have to make a faith leap. Or I do, anyway. But, like I said, in light of my experiences, for me it would be illogical not to have faith.I see the errors already but I'm going to hold off on replying until the last couple of drinks I had wear off.	But, like I said, after my experiences, for me it would be illogical not to have faith	1

get it over with	Then — and I will never forget the look of rage on his face — he screams something about how if we all hate him then he should just get it over with, grabs the edge of the picnic table with both hands, leans way back, and then swings himself forward at full force slamming his face down onto the table top	Many years ago when I was still in Scouts, there was this kid — I'll call him Aaron 'cause that was his fucking name — who was a very strange and somewhat disturbed young man.  He was friendly with my younger brother and they hung out sometimes.  Anyway, we're all hanging out at camp, different groups of kids doing different things, and Aaron, my brother, and a few others are sitting at a picnic table.Everyone was playing cards and Aaron tried to make some play that was invalid (I don't remember what it was, just a move against the rules of whatever game they were playing).  They called him on it and told him that he couldn't do that and he needed to change what he played.  Everyone was being pretty calm about it and just trying to explain that it was against the rules, but apparently Aaron felt that everyone was singling him out or some shit.So, Aaron is getting pretty upset about everything and starts screaming about how everyone hates him and they're always ganging up on him.Then — and I will never forget the look of rage on his face — he screams something about how if we all hate him then he should just get it over with, grabs the edge of the picnic table with both hands, leans way back, and then swings himself forward at full force slamming his face down onto the table top.  He then does this a couple more times before someone manages to stop him.Everyone was completely shocked... I cannot even begin to describe witnessing this event.  Aaron's face is covered with blood, he is screaming about us hating him, sobbing uncontrollably over the pain and humiliation... it was all sorts of fucked up.A few hours later, he was under control, though a bit sedated, and pretty much acted as if the incident hadn't really even occurred.  Everyone was on tip toes around him for months afterwards.

I think it was noble for you to help out your mother, and also to confront her about the conversation that you overheard, but while moving out is a good idea, I think you should still send her some money her way.  I don't mean your entire income, but just enough for her to get by, and apply for any gov't grants available for her situation (like you said, disabled, widowed, etc)  Another thing that you have to do is talk to your sister about what's going to happen as essentially (sorry to put it this way) but you're abandoning your mother.

change of heart	So I worked it all out, I invited him to a friends place where we could be alone, telling him I had a change of heart	I was in high school and dating this guy who wanted to go "all the way". I told him I wasn't ready (I was pretty conservative) and he promptly went around school telling everyone we "did the deed" (His words, not mine) as well as several other pretty graphic things. He also went to several school counselors and told them I had a few STD's, which caused me to get pulled out of class to be talked to. Some of my teachers were even informed.So I worked it all out, I invited him to a friends place where we could be alone, telling him I had a change of heart.

I had him go first out the door, then promptly yanked the blanket off of him, pulled the sliding glass door shut and locked it.

jump to conclusions	These are generally the most productive immigrants in Canada, however the immigration system as a whole is a net benefit to Canada and one shouldn't jump to conclusions about any of the categories	I think you're mixing things up here.

However I think you'll find that if you observe the government's immigration policy over the last 5 years, it has vastly improved.

rule of thumb	In general it's a good rule of thumb that if it comes right after a preposition, you should probably use "whom"	In general it's a good rule of thumb that if it comes right after a preposition, you should probably use "whom".   The problem in this case is that "To whoever started this . . . " isn't really a sentence.  You can see that "whoever started this" is a complete noun phrase, into which you can substitute "he" or "him" to see which one sounds right.  You're addressing your letter "to [noun phrase]".As BHSPitMonkey points out tho it really just boils down to whether the mystery person in question is a *subject* (the person *doing* something, in this case "starting this trend") or an *object* (the person that something *is being done to*, as in the letter appellation "to whom it may concern" where "it" is the subject which is doing the action of concerning).Anyway.  When in doubt, go with "who".  You'll get more flack for over-deploying "whom" than you will for under-deploying it.

blow off steam	Actually I don't fucking care if you have to punch a wall, or go to the gym to blow off steam	As a trans girl, I honestly don't give a shit if you are not attracted to me cause of my history. Sure it sucks for me if I happen to fall in love with you.

I'll try and grab at the cold wall and feel my fingers bump across the gaps in my hard wood falls.

hit the nail on the head	I think you hit the nail on the head	I think you hit the nail on the head... when talking about contemporary Americans. It a very narcissistic culture of close-minded self-certainty. Essentially if you were to meet a decent, honest, open-minded, thoughtful person, they would almost certainly respond to you (and even your insults) in a way that was satisfactory and that would likely lead to increased understanding for you both.On the other hand, you write like you are 16 which means that people are likely going to dismiss what you say based on the context, regardless of how much sense you make.If by any chance you are 16ish, that is great!  You have your whole life ahead of you.  One simple lesson to learn is that the people closest to you, and especially the ones you love, will say (and believe) shit that blows your mind and makes you lose all faith in humanity for the sheer stupidity, meanness, and ignorance involved.  This will make you doubt humanity.  Solution: Unknown.  Workaround: Make sure the friends you make are not the kind of fools that you are ranting about.  (Fools, yes, but fun and funny fools.)

out of thin air	Whatever the encoding or compression, 10Mbps is 10Mbps; you're not going to create information out of thin air further down the line	On the contrary, I think the theoretical maximum bandwidths are fascinating from an engineering standpoint.

come to mind	No drugstore products come to mind other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is	Stick foundations are a lot heavier and can be more challenging to use while learning to blend them out evening. They are mainly used for people who need really full to maximum coverage. I have heard that they can be more pore-clogging yes, generally because they are heavier, and the people who often use them need to use a lot, or a thick layer. If you're spot-covering though, it may be fine. As for the second question, it all depends on the formula of the product. Bobbi Brown and Shisedo both make a great stick foundation, though they're expensive (around $40 each). No drugstore products come to mind other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is. You may want to try a cream-to-powder or cream foundation (in a compact, something like Covergirl's Aquasmooth or Maybelline Dream Smooth Mousse) if you're interested in that sort of coverage/finish.

tip of the iceberg	Do you realize what these fuckers have cost us (Wisconsinites) in jobs alone, not to mention tax revenue?!Collective bargaining is just the tip of the iceberg	I think it's a good idea, and I'm downvoting you. Also, I'm not only voting today because of collective bargaining, but because of the body of work the Republicans have done. Their misleading mailers telling people to send in absentee ballots by Thursday (after today's election), their voter registration requirements designed to prevent people from voting, their corporate giveaways to their rich pals, the Kock brothers, their fucking over the entire state on a high speed rail project, their fucking over the entire state on what would have been the largest wind farm. Do you realize what these fuckers have cost us (Wisconsinites) in jobs alone, not to mention tax revenue?!Collective bargaining is just the tip of the iceberg. So don't sit there and pretend Walker is a victim in this. He dug his own grave, as did the Republicans who are up for recall today. I just hope this state has the good sense to throw them all out on their smug asses.Also, the short term results from one school district are hardly representative of an entire state, regardless of what someone's blog and some right-wing rag I've never heard of say (or perhaps one of their top articles "Obamaphiles still longing for Camelot" isn't what I think it is).edit: Downvotes without a single rational argument refuting any of the points mentioned above. Seems the Republicans and Teabaggers have shown up today.

out of nowhere	She wasn't thinking about your best interests when she ended it out of nowhere, so don't think of her best interests	I haven't been through a divorce but I did live with someone for 6 years who, out of the blue, dumped me, stole a bunch of money from me, and basically acted like the entire time we were together never happened.I pondered and pondered why this happened, why me, etc. Until one day I realized that you can't rationalize crazy. So if someone does some crazy shit, there is no sense trying to figure it out because it will *never* make sense. I won't lie. It hurt for a long time.

Don't let your ex manipulate you into doing things you don't want to do.

hit the nail on the head	I think you hit the nail on the head	I think you hit the nail on the head... when talking about contemporary Americans. It a very narcissistic culture of close-minded self-certainty. Essentially if you were to meet a decent, honest, open-minded, thoughtful person, they would almost certainly respond to you (and even your insults) in a way that was satisfactory and that would likely lead to increased understanding for you both.On the other hand, you write like you are 16 which means that people are likely going to dismiss what you say based on the context, regardless of how much sense you make.If by any chance you are 16ish, that is great!  You have your whole life ahead of you.  One simple lesson to learn is that the people closest to you, and especially the ones you love, will say (and believe) shit that blows your mind and makes you lose all faith in humanity for the sheer stupidity, meanness, and ignorance involved.

come to mind	No drugstore products come to mind other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is	Stick foundations are a lot heavier and can be more challenging to use while learning to blend them out evening. They are mainly used for people who need really full to maximum coverage. I have heard that they can be more pore-clogging yes, generally because they are heavier, and the people who often use them need to use a lot, or a thick layer. If you're spot-covering though, it may be fine. As for the second question, it all depends on the formula of the product. Bobbi Brown and Shisedo both make a great stick foundation, though they're expensive (around $40 each). No drugstore products come to mind other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is. You may want to try a cream-to-powder or cream foundation (in a compact, something like Covergirl's Aquasmooth or Maybelline Dream Smooth Mousse) if you're interested in that sort of coverage/finish. They both work really well for redness.	No drugstore products come to skull other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is	0

on the same page	The odds of two people really being on the same page aren't all that great	I think being promiscuous is a bad thing. Sex has a nasty tendency of having a bunch of emotions tied to it. The odds of two people really being on the same page aren't all that great. So you're taking on the risk of one or two people getting hurt in the process of being vulnerable and open, and possibly hindering their ability to develop happy sexual relationships in the future. Do some people manage to have happy slutty lifestyles without hurting others? Well of course. Is it risky (in the sense of risking pregnancy, STDs and heartbreak)? Obviously. IMO in a macroeconomic sense the benefits don't outweigh the costs.	The odds of two people really having different opinions isn't all that great	0

change of heart	So I worked it all out, I invited him to a friends place where we could be alone, telling him I had a change of heart	I was in high school and dating this guy who wanted to go "all the way". I told him I wasn't ready (I was pretty conservative) and he promptly went around school telling everyone we "did the deed" (His words, not mine) as well as several other pretty graphic things. He also went to several school counselors and told them I had a few STD's, which caused me to get pulled out of class to be talked to. Some of my teachers were even informed.So I worked it all out, I invited him to a friends place where we could be alone, telling him I had a change of heart. I got him down to his boxers, while I stayed completely clothed. I wrapped myself in a blanket and told him I needed some air on the balcony and wanted him to come with me. Note that we were in an apartment. On the 3rd floor. During an blizzard.In the middle of the night. I had him go first out the door, then promptly yanked the blanket off of him, pulled the sliding glass door shut and locked it. I then locked the front door, called the police to inform them of a flasher. It was in the paper the next day.

hit the nail on the head	I think you hit the nail on the head	I think you hit the nail on the head... when talking about contemporary Americans. It a very narcissistic culture of close-minded self-certainty. Essentially if you were to meet a decent, honest, open-minded, thoughtful person, they would almost certainly respond to you (and even your insults) in a way that was satisfactory and that would likely lead to increased understanding for you both.On the other hand, you write like you are 16 which means that people are likely going to dismiss what you say based on the context, regardless of how much sense you make.If by any chance you are 16ish, that is great!  You have your whole life ahead of you.  One simple lesson to learn is that the people closest to you, and especially the ones you love, will say (and believe) shit that blows your mind and makes you lose all faith in humanity for the sheer stupidity, meanness, and ignorance involved.  This will make you doubt humanity.  Solution: Unknown.  Workaround: Make sure the friends you make are not the kind of fools that you are ranting about.  (Fools, yes, but fun and funny fools.)

get it over with	Then — and I will never forget the look of rage on his face — he screams something about how if we all hate him then he should just get it over with, grabs the edge of the picnic table with both hands, leans way back, and then swings himself forward at full force slamming his face down onto the table top	Many years ago when I was still in Scouts, there was this kid — I'll call him Aaron 'cause that was his fucking name — who was a very strange and somewhat disturbed young man.  He was friendly with my younger brother and they hung out sometimes.  Anyway, we're all hanging out at camp, different groups of kids doing different things, and Aaron, my brother, and a few others are sitting at a picnic table.Everyone was playing cards and Aaron tried to make some play that was invalid (I don't remember what it was, just a move against the rules of whatever game they were playing).  They called him on it and told him that he couldn't do that and he needed to change what he played.  Everyone was being pretty calm about it and just trying to explain that it was against the rules, but apparently Aaron felt that everyone was singling him out or some shit.So, Aaron is getting pretty upset about everything and starts screaming about how everyone hates him and they're always ganging up on him.Then — and I will never forget the look of rage on his face — he screams something about how if we all hate him then he should just get it over with, grabs the edge of the picnic table with both hands, leans way back, and then swings himself forward at full force slamming his face down onto the table top.  He then does this a couple more times before someone manages to stop him.Everyone was completely shocked... I cannot even begin to describe witnessing this event.  Aaron's face is covered with blood, he is screaming about us hating him, sobbing uncontrollably over the pain and humiliation... it was all sorts of fucked up.A few hours later, he was under control, though a bit sedated, and pretty much acted as if the incident hadn't really even occurred.  Everyone was on tip toes around him for months afterwards.

on the right track	I think you're on the right track for first version antennas	Outstanding!   Don't worry too much about damaging the transmitter in the FT-840, you would have to do something unique and unexpected to fool the power amplifier protection circuit into letting you damage it with just poor load match while tuning. You may find the Astron RS-20 a bit light for your station, most hams I speak to say that it's true that Astron supplies will make their rated current, but only briefly. If you plan to do any modes that require long transmissions at high power, the RS-20 will make a nice heater until it fails... the rule of thumb that I use with Astrons is less than 1/2 rated current if you are going to run continuous load, and let it rest a while if it's getting uncomfortable to touch it. For CW and SSB, have at it until the supply overheats, then listen around the band for a while. I think you're on the right track for first version antennas. My "utility" antenna is a 450 ohm ladder line to a "dipole" rigged as an inverted V, with the apex 90 feet up my tower, 70 foot "legs", and the ends dragged out to make the "V" angle about 90 degrees..... it ain't as good as the Steppir that's above it, but very handy. Your adjustable impedance matching device will fix (or hide) your impedance matching problem. Loops are also a handy choice for wire antennas, if you plan to just use the tuner to fix the "random" impedance, longer is better (to a point). Purpose built loops and dipoles have remarkably good performance for being simple wires.... I'm especially fond of 66 foot loops for the 20 meter band.... an equilateral triangular loop, 1 wavelength around, held up at the apex, with the "corners" staked out tight, with the base about 10 feet above the ground.... feed it in the middle of the base with a simple BalUn .... the feed impedance will be about 100 ohms.... use 1/4 wavelength of 75 ohm TV coax to transform to 50 ohms, then any length of 50 ohm cable to get to the radio, no tuner required .... "cut length" half wave dipoles are easy too, and require no tuner..... at 100 watts and HF, cheap coax (RG-58) is good enough for Jazz.... for reasonable distances.... maybe 100 feet or so..... as you move "up band" loss becomes a problem with cheap coax..... start thinking about cable loss above 21 MHz.... think hard about coax at 144 MHz...... for the overachieving computer geek, antenna simulation software is readily available for cheap.... Start here http://www.eznec.com/  download the demo... play with the example antennas..... when you run out of space in the demo, send W7EL his money for the full program.... when you get good at antenna simulation complain that EZNEC is too limited.... spend BIG money on commercial simulator :-)..... 100 watts and a simple (well considered) antenna will do lots of HF radio for you... Life is too short for QRP, 100 watts on HF is good place to start, ham radio sucks if you make no contacts because nobody hears you... 1.5KW and a beam is better!.. QRP is the ham radio equivalent to fly fishing, expect to be hungry.... no matter how long you fool around with antennas you will never be satisfied, there's always a better one to build next week.... Talk to as many other hams as possible about antennas, don't believe most of what they say, use what they say to start your own investigation, make up your own mind about what's "right". Any group of 5 hams will have 7 different opinions about all subjects...... 73 / VRY GOOD DX OM DE WB7RSG	I think you're unlikley to succeed for first version antennas	0
in light of	But, like I said, in light of my experiences, for me it would be illogical not to have faith	Thanks for the excellent advice. Here is his reply. Putting it in text so you can quote if you need to. Counter-counters! :) And I don't like not being able to press enter to make this all organized.... .........1. We KNOW something we call "gravity" exists, but we have FAITH that it'll be in effect when we wake up in the morning. Obviously, this is a pretty safe leap of faith, but just saying. Evolution has evidence, yes, but it's holey evidence. If my lineage cannot be traced back to a monkey strictly empirically, saying that I evolved from a monkey is a leap of faith. Yeah, saying I evolved from a monkey makes logical sense, considering the premises of evolution, but just because something is logical, doesn't mean it is true. Science has yet to prove macroevolution. There's a good case for it... but there's a better case for God, I believe. The evidence for God, for me, would be the fact we exist. Nothing comes from nothing, all that. In any case, we certainly didn't evolve into existence. And why existence, rather than non-existence? All those fun questions. This doesn't prove anything, and it's circular, but- would there be scientific evidence for the God who created science? Fun question, I think. .............2. Atheists have faith that God doesn't exist, based on their notions of what existence means or is. I don't mean to say they have a supernatural faith, but rather that they have faith in a set of beliefs that shape how they view the world. Atheistic beliefs. Basically- that God doesn't exist, even though they can't prove that. Atheist faith. .............3. Right. But the fact that the turmoil leads them to cling tightly to God can't rule the possibility of God out, either. That would be a double standard, and unfair. They do need something to believe in, desperately. We all do. They have found it, due largely to their circumstances. I wouldn't say God is tearing apart His faithful- although, if He were, we wouldn't be in a position to cast judgement on Him, He's God- I would say He is using the terrible situations to bring them closer to Him. "Working for their good," as we Christians would say. The perception that God punishes is an inaccurate one, I think. I think it is certainly in His power to do so, but Jesus' life was a message of grace, forgiveness, mercy, etc. The world is screwed up, but that's hardly God's fault. We live here. ................4. I didn't mean that faith is superior, although some do. I just meant that I wasn't trying to provide a rational/logical basis for my faith. You simply can't do that, all the way. Finite logic ends at some point, and you have to make a faith leap. Or I do, anyway. But, like I said, in light of my experiences, for me it would be illogical not to have faith.I see the errors already but I'm going to hold off on replying until the last couple of drinks I had wear off.	But, like I said, after my experiences, for me it would be illogical not to have faith	1

Also, I'm not only voting today because of collective bargaining, but because of the body of work the Republicans have done. Their misleading mailers telling people to send in absentee ballots by Thursday (after today's election), their voter registration requirements designed to prevent people from voting, their corporate giveaways to their rich pals, the Kock brothers, their fucking over the entire state on a high speed rail project, their fucking over the entire state on what would have been the largest wind farm.

take a stand	I've pointed out what all religions have in common, and that this consistently leads to immorality; I think you'll find it hard to take a stand for any well regarded set of secular moral principles and then show any religion achieving those principles better than a purely non-religious practice of those same principles	&gt; This entirely depends on one accepting the basic premise that utilitarianism is better than any other moral theory, religious or otherwise.Please don't misunderstand me: I pulled up my own favorite moral system as an example close to hand.

Though we can look at the Abrahamic religions as having these qualities, and indeed some other ones as well, there is no reason to think that religion requires one to "defend their beliefs" against all comers.There absolutely is. No religion that fails to do this survives. None. Though you're strawmanning a bit when you paraphrase me as "defending against all comers." The more important defense is against apostasy, i.e. against "goers." You can even do without that, if you're at least aggressively evangelic.

come to mind	No drugstore products come to mind other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is	Stick foundations are a lot heavier and can be more challenging to use while learning to blend them out evening. They are mainly used for people who need really full to maximum coverage. I have heard that they can be more pore-clogging yes, generally because they are heavier, and the people who often use them need to use a lot, or a thick layer. If you're spot-covering though, it may be fine. As for the second question, it all depends on the formula of the product. Bobbi Brown and Shisedo both make a great stick foundation, though they're expensive (around $40 each). No drugstore products come to mind other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is. You may want to try a cream-to-powder or cream foundation (in a compact, something like Covergirl's Aquasmooth or Maybelline Dream Smooth Mousse) if you're interested in that sort of coverage/finish. They both work really well for redness.	No drugstore products are forgotten other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is	0

out of thin air	Whatever the encoding or compression, 10Mbps is 10Mbps; you're not going to create information out of thin air further down the line	On the contrary, I think the theoretical maximum bandwidths are fascinating from an engineering standpoint. Whatever the encoding or compression, 10Mbps is 10Mbps; you're not going to create information out of thin air further down the line.Sure, you're not going to reverse-engineer windows by knowing how much data your HDMI cable can carry, and it might not even help you figure out how many pixels the monitor has. But if I had to reverse-engineer the HDMI standard, the very first thing I'd want to know is how fast and sensitive I'd need my oscilloscope to be.TLDR: It's not going to give you a lot of insight into anything else, but bandwidth is bandwidth, and saying "10 Mbps at most" is a lot more informative than just leaving it at "we don't use bytes".

through the roof	Thats when I wake up in a jolt with my heart rate through the roof hoping I'm actually awake, not dreaming I'm awake	I've posted this tale before but its kind of relevant I'm not sure it counts:When I got injured as a kid I got put on morphine and I had a hallucination that I was pulled out the bed and dragged across the floor under a bed across the ward. It was beyond realistic, to the point i swear I could feel the cold floor scratching my hands as I tried to grab for something to stop me being dragged into the dark space under the other bed.Every now and then this comes back to me in sleep except its worse because I will dream I wake up and its dark but something is wrong so I'll try to get up but my legs will be all wobbly and I'll fall over and then whatever it is will grab my legs, its not so much hands but just pressure. I'll try and grab at the cold wall and feel my fingers bump across the gaps in my hard wood falls. The worst thing is I can never scream for some reason I can try really hard to scream but just feel like I'm choking.

pain in the ass	I once caught him rip a vent off of the front counter where our ice machine was housed, that was a pain in the ass to put back on	A little back story:  There was a family that always came into the family owned restaurant I used to work at.  The family always consisted of the dad, son, and another grown man (maybe brother to the dad, we never found out).  The mother had never seen, but the dad had a wedding ring and always threatened the kid with 'You better act right or your mother will not be happy!'  The sad part, the kid had down syndrome we think (no one was a professional), the older man could not speak, and the dad was just kind of out there.  This family, or half family, whatever you want to call it, would always come in 7-10 times a week, sometimes 2 times a day, and spend no less than $40 when they would order food.  The kid would always go nuts wanting something whenever he walked in the door and would be throwing and slamming shit all over the place.  Right after the dad would pay I would be giving him the change and the kid would see the change and the receipt and start yelling "I WANT MONEY!!" and absolutely go ape shit!  The first few times were hilarious as fuck, but after about 2 weeks of them coming in we started to get tired of the shit because it wasn't like they were the only ones in the restaurant at all.  (We were at the point to where we were like you want money?  Come over here and ill shove a fucking roll of quarters down your throat so you shut the fuck up!)  We constantly had other customers asking how much longer for their food, run out the door, and leave as fast as possible.  The kid at one point was getting so bad that he would take the trays, throw and slam them against the booths or whatever was closest for him to destroy.  The real turning point was the day that, well first was violently shaking and about to break the candy machine when I yelled at him to cut it out, then he came over to the counter and grabbed the pin pad, and started slamming it against the counter.  Like this kid had no boundaries of what he wouldn't do.  I once caught him rip a vent off of the front counter where our ice machine was housed, that was a pain in the ass to put back on.  It got to the point where one of us had to go babysit the kid so he wouldn't fuck anything up, not to mention this was while we were busy too.  The owner finally got fed up with it and banned them from coming back.  The dad was furious at us and even the mom called saying she was going to sue us for discriminating against her mentally challenged son.  Pretty much he did not care.  About 4 or 5 months later, nothing happened so it was just a bluff.  A couple of saw these people around at other restaurants and the kid still acted the same and no mother was ever around.  I have not seen them since this, but they are now some other restaurants problem.Now I still feel like a piece of shit for making fun of the kid, but it was seriously some of the funniest shit I had ever seen.

tip of the iceberg	Do you realize what these fuckers have cost us (Wisconsinites) in jobs alone, not to mention tax revenue?!Collective bargaining is just the tip of the iceberg	I think it's a good idea, and I'm downvoting you. Also, I'm not only voting today because of collective bargaining, but because of the body of work the Republicans have done. Their misleading mailers telling people to send in absentee ballots by Thursday (after today's election), their voter registration requirements designed to prevent people from voting, their corporate giveaways to their rich pals, the Kock brothers, their fucking over the entire state on a high speed rail project, their fucking over the entire state on what would have been the largest wind farm.

out of the blue	What's your reaction when some coincidence like that hits? And what's your favorite story along those lines of a player hitting big on something out of the blue?	Mkay, my question comes with a story:In New Orleans 6 years ago, my wife and I walked into Harrah's and went to the roulette table. A running joke we have is that whenever my wife walks up to a table, the 6 comes up, and it's always too soon or too late for me to bet. So I plunked $20 on the 6 as my first bet, before the ball was in motion. There were 4 other players. I asked how the table was running, and they said it was a glacier. Of course, the next spin hit the 6. I will never forget the look on that croupier's face: He gave me a stone-cold look, checking to see if I'd somehow cheated.

smoke and mirrors	It's always going to be smoke and mirrors, to some extent	In order to use this technology, you'd have to combine both "unlimited detail" voxels with regular polygons. This is actually similar to how games work right now: we can draw VERY detailed content, as long as its static (unchanging). The data can be preprocessed so that all the data structures are in place to do efficient clipping and level-of-detail. Anything that has animation and/or physics applied to it is rendered separately, and less efficiently. But because there's significantly less of it, it works out. For instance, right now you generally don't see real-time deformation and physics applied to the ENTIRE environment, but only to portions of it (one building, certain objects, characters).So, use "unlimited detail" for your terrain and buildings. Then put your normal polygonal skeleton keyframe physics animated entities on top of it.It's always going to be smoke and mirrors, to some extent.

on the brink	From up here, it looks less and less like the US is in decline, and more and more like it's on the brink of all-out collapse	I moved to Canada about 10 years ago... lucky enough to be a duel citizen. Part of it was politics; most of it was just for personal reasons--needing a change, getting away, etc... Just like you, i thought that if everyone left but the scumbags, it would just make things worse. I always assumed I'd move back after a few years.Now: My mom is moving up here tomorrow, because even with medicare, she can't *ever* afford to retire if she stays in the states, even though the cost of living is actually much higher up here, and she's already 67. She's Canadian, but she's lived in the US for the past 37 years, and is leaving all her friends and other family behind.More telling, my older brother, also duel, and a conservative christian, is moving up here in about 9 months. He's a born again, ex-Bush W. supporting republican, who got laid-off, worked on the Obama campaign, and now is bailing back to the homeland, too (he was 5 years old when we moved to the US... I was 0). He realized about a year ago that if he stayed in the US there is basically no hope for a future for either he or his family (he has a wife and 2 kids).  the US has moved way too far away from even his values, and voting Democrat doesn't help. It seems like even if there were only 9 Republicans in the House of Reps, and 1 in the Senate, they would still get everything they demanded... an end to environmental protections, security and care for those in mansions and gated communities, and shit-soup for everyone else.As for me, like I said, I'd always planned to go back to the US eventually, but, fuck it, I'm done. Every time I vote in Canada, even now after all these years, it's so refreshing to just mark an "X" in the circle by the name, and drop it into the box. No voting machines, no "hanging chads", no questions about registration (not registered? show up to the polls with an ID and a piece of mail with your address... that's it), no bullshit. I don't like Stephen Harper at all, but at least I know the Torys were legitimately elected, and at this point, they're still to the left of the madness of even the Dems in the US.From up here, it looks less and less like the US is in decline, and more and more like it's on the brink of all-out collapse.tl;dr: to answer your question, no, i don't think so at all.	From up here, it looks less and less like the US is in decline, and more and more like it's quite far from all-out collapse	0
jump to conclusions	These are generally the most productive immigrants in Canada, however the immigration system as a whole is a net benefit to Canada and one shouldn't jump to conclusions about any of the categories	I think you're mixing things up here. There's no '*economic refugee*' status, it's actually [economic immigration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Canada#Immigration_categories). These are generally the most productive immigrants in Canada, however the immigration system as a whole is a net benefit to Canada and one shouldn't jump to conclusions about any of the categories.Immigrants generally pay the same amount of taxes and receive the same amount of government services as Canadians who were born here ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_immigration_to_Canada#Government_finances)); and because we don't have a replacement birthrate, immigration is key to circumventing many demographic challenges that Canada will face in the near future.As for our refugee system, there are serious problems with those who would circumvent the intention of the system. However I think you'll find that if you observe the government's immigration policy over the last 5 years, it has vastly improved.

out of nowhere	She wasn't thinking about your best interests when she ended it out of nowhere, so don't think of her best interests	I haven't been through a divorce but I did live with someone for 6 years who, out of the blue, dumped me, stole a bunch of money from me, and basically acted like the entire time we were together never happened.I pondered and pondered why this happened, why me, etc. Until one day I realized that you can't rationalize crazy. So if someone does some crazy shit, there is no sense trying to figure it out because it will *never* make sense. I won't lie. It hurt for a long time.

take a stand	I've pointed out what all religions have in common, and that this consistently leads to immorality; I think you'll find it hard to take a stand for any well regarded set of secular moral principles and then show any religion achieving those principles better than a purely non-religious practice of those same principles	&gt; This entirely depends on one accepting the basic premise that utilitarianism is better than any other moral theory, religious or otherwise.Please don't misunderstand me: I pulled up my own favorite moral system as an example close to hand. Society is certainly still discussing what the best system could be, and what it entails. Kant's Categorical Imperative is also in the running, though I'm not sure its applicability is broad enough to stand alone. I'm happy to base my argument on whatever modern and widely supported moral system you prefer - I'll trust your good judgment here.&gt; Your view of religion is, I would say, flawed in some respects. Though we can look at the Abrahamic religions as having these qualities, and indeed some other ones as well, there is no reason to think that religion requires one to "defend their beliefs" against all comers.There absolutely is. No religion that fails to do this survives. None. Though you're strawmanning a bit when you paraphrase me as "defending against all comers." The more important defense is against apostasy, i.e. against "goers." You can even do without that, if you're at least aggressively evangelic. But a religion without injunctions for capturing in its population is bound to fail. This is not base and simplistic, it is universal. Show me a functioning religion that neither advertises, nor indoctrinates its children, nor discourages people from leaving!I'm sorry you misunderstood my ticket anecdote. I failed to defend my car, and this turns out to have been illegal - I fell afoul of my society's moral standards."Virtue" is just another name for "morals" or isn't it? Yes, pacifism might not be immoral under different systems of morality. Maybe I shouldn't have ventured into this aside, I just wanted to show that it's a mistake to think that pacifists are automatically the more moral.&gt; What I am saying is that it's unjustified to paint all religion under one broad stroke.You absolutely haven't shown this. I've pointed out what all religions have in common, and that this consistently leads to immorality; I think you'll find it hard to take a stand for any well regarded set of secular moral principles and then show any religion achieving those principles better than a purely non-religious practice of those same principles.

on the same page	The odds of two people really being on the same page aren't all that great	I think being promiscuous is a bad thing. Sex has a nasty tendency of having a bunch of emotions tied to it. The odds of two people really being on the same page aren't all that great. So you're taking on the risk of one or two people getting hurt in the process of being vulnerable and open, and possibly hindering their ability to develop happy sexual relationships in the future. Do some people manage to have happy slutty lifestyles without hurting others? Well of course. Is it risky (in the sense of risking pregnancy, STDs and heartbreak)? Obviously.

I'll try and grab at the cold wall and feel my fingers bump across the gaps in my hard wood falls.

out of the blue	What's your reaction when some coincidence like that hits? And what's your favorite story along those lines of a player hitting big on something out of the blue?	Mkay, my question comes with a story:In New Orleans 6 years ago, my wife and I walked into Harrah's and went to the roulette table. A running joke we have is that whenever my wife walks up to a table, the 6 comes up, and it's always too soon or too late for me to bet. So I plunked $20 on the 6 as my first bet, before the ball was in motion. There were 4 other players. I asked how the table was running, and they said it was a glacier.

smoke and mirrors	It's always going to be smoke and mirrors, to some extent	In order to use this technology, you'd have to combine both "unlimited detail" voxels with regular polygons. This is actually similar to how games work right now: we can draw VERY detailed content, as long as its static (unchanging). The data can be preprocessed so that all the data structures are in place to do efficient clipping and level-of-detail. Anything that has animation and/or physics applied to it is rendered separately, and less efficiently. But because there's significantly less of it, it works out. For instance, right now you generally don't see real-time deformation and physics applied to the ENTIRE environment, but only to portions of it (one building, certain objects, characters).So, use "unlimited detail" for your terrain and buildings. Then put your normal polygonal skeleton keyframe physics animated entities on top of it.It's always going to be smoke and mirrors, to some extent.

A running joke we have is that whenever my wife walks up to a table, the 6 comes up, and it's always too soon or too late for me to bet. So I plunked $20 on the 6 as my first bet, before the ball was in motion. There were 4 other players. I asked how the table was running, and they said it was a glacier. Of course, the next spin hit the 6. I will never forget the look on that croupier's face: He gave me a stone-cold look, checking to see if I'd somehow cheated. What's your reaction when some coincidence like that hits? And what's your favorite story along those lines of a player hitting big on something out of the blue?

They called him on it and told him that he couldn't do that and he needed to change what he played.  Everyone was being pretty calm about it and just trying to explain that it was against the rules, but apparently Aaron felt that everyone was singling him out or some shit.So, Aaron is getting pretty upset about everything and starts screaming about how everyone hates him and they're always ganging up on him.Then — and I will never forget the look of rage on his face — he screams something about how if we all hate him then he should just get it over with, grabs the edge of the picnic table with both hands, leans way back, and then swings himself forward at full force slamming his face down onto the table top.

in light of	But, like I said, in light of my experiences, for me it would be illogical not to have faith	Thanks for the excellent advice. Here is his reply. Putting it in text so you can quote if you need to. Counter-counters! :) And I don't like not being able to press enter to make this all organized.... .........1. We KNOW something we call "gravity" exists, but we have FAITH that it'll be in effect when we wake up in the morning. Obviously, this is a pretty safe leap of faith, but just saying. Evolution has evidence, yes, but it's holey evidence. If my lineage cannot be traced back to a monkey strictly empirically, saying that I evolved from a monkey is a leap of faith. Yeah, saying I evolved from a monkey makes logical sense, considering the premises of evolution, but just because something is logical, doesn't mean it is true. Science has yet to prove macroevolution. There's a good case for it... but there's a better case for God, I believe. The evidence for God, for me, would be the fact we exist. Nothing comes from nothing, all that. In any case, we certainly didn't evolve into existence. And why existence, rather than non-existence? All those fun questions. This doesn't prove anything, and it's circular, but- would there be scientific evidence for the God who created science? Fun question, I think. .............2. Atheists have faith that God doesn't exist, based on their notions of what existence means or is. I don't mean to say they have a supernatural faith, but rather that they have faith in a set of beliefs that shape how they view the world. Atheistic beliefs. Basically- that God doesn't exist, even though they can't prove that. Atheist faith. .............3. Right. But the fact that the turmoil leads them to cling tightly to God can't rule the possibility of God out, either. That would be a double standard, and unfair. They do need something to believe in, desperately. We all do. They have found it, due largely to their circumstances. I wouldn't say God is tearing apart His faithful- although, if He were, we wouldn't be in a position to cast judgement on Him, He's God- I would say He is using the terrible situations to bring them closer to Him. "Working for their good," as we Christians would say. The perception that God punishes is an inaccurate one, I think. I think it is certainly in His power to do so, but Jesus' life was a message of grace, forgiveness, mercy, etc. The world is screwed up, but that's hardly God's fault. We live here. ................4. I didn't mean that faith is superior, although some do. I just meant that I wasn't trying to provide a rational/logical basis for my faith. You simply can't do that, all the way. Finite logic ends at some point, and you have to make a faith leap. Or I do, anyway.

rule of thumb	In general it's a good rule of thumb that if it comes right after a preposition, you should probably use "whom"	In general it's a good rule of thumb that if it comes right after a preposition, you should probably use "whom".   The problem in this case is that "To whoever started this . . . " isn't really a sentence.  You can see that "whoever started this" is a complete noun phrase, into which you can substitute "he" or "him" to see which one sounds right.  You're addressing your letter "to [noun phrase]".As BHSPitMonkey points out tho it really just boils down to whether the mystery person in question is a *subject* (the person *doing* something, in this case "starting this trend") or an *object* (the person that something *is being done to*, as in the letter appellation "to whom it may concern" where "it" is the subject which is doing the action of concerning).Anyway.  When in doubt, go with "who".  You'll get more flack for over-deploying "whom" than you will for under-deploying it.

on the brink	From up here, it looks less and less like the US is in decline, and more and more like it's on the brink of all-out collapse	I moved to Canada about 10 years ago... lucky enough to be a duel citizen. Part of it was politics; most of it was just for personal reasons--needing a change, getting away, etc... Just like you, i thought that if everyone left but the scumbags, it would just make things worse. I always assumed I'd move back after a few years.Now: My mom is moving up here tomorrow, because even with medicare, she can't *ever* afford to retire if she stays in the states, even though the cost of living is actually much higher up here, and she's already 67. She's Canadian, but she's lived in the US for the past 37 years, and is leaving all her friends and other family behind.More telling, my older brother, also duel, and a conservative christian, is moving up here in about 9 months. He's a born again, ex-Bush W. supporting republican, who got laid-off, worked on the Obama campaign, and now is bailing back to the homeland, too (he was 5 years old when we moved to the US... I was 0). He realized about a year ago that if he stayed in the US there is basically no hope for a future for either he or his family (he has a wife and 2 kids).  the US has moved way too far away from even his values, and voting Democrat doesn't help. It seems like even if there were only 9 Republicans in the House of Reps, and 1 in the Senate, they would still get everything they demanded... an end to environmental protections, security and care for those in mansions and gated communities, and shit-soup for everyone else.As for me, like I said, I'd always planned to go back to the US eventually, but, fuck it, I'm done. Every time I vote in Canada, even now after all these years, it's so refreshing to just mark an "X" in the circle by the name, and drop it into the box. No voting machines, no "hanging chads", no questions about registration (not registered? show up to the polls with an ID and a piece of mail with your address... that's it), no bullshit. I don't like Stephen Harper at all, but at least I know the Torys were legitimately elected, and at this point, they're still to the left of the madness of even the Dems in the US.From up here, it looks less and less like the US is in decline, and more and more like it's on the brink of all-out collapse.tl;dr: to answer your question, no, i don't think so at all.

in the works	Salvation has been in the works throughout all of the timeline	I think limiting a God who lives outside of time with a timeline may be a bit presumptive on our part. It is the teaching of my Church that the work of Christ extends both backwards and fowards through all time; his incarnation, life, death, and resurrection are the focal point of all history. We also teach that the God that is revealed in the Old Testament is Christ himself before he was born in time as a man. Salvation has been in the works throughout all of the timeline.Regarding salvation for others, we believe Christ conquered death by death on behalf of all. As you put it, he opened the gates of heaven. An Easter hymn of ours says:&gt;Christ is risen from the dead,&gt;Trampling down death by death,&gt;And upon those in the tombs&gt;Bestowing life!We believe we have had to way to God revealed to us through Christ; we say little to nothing about those outside of the Church. "We know where the Church is; we do not know where it is not." This isn't universalism, but it leaves that hope open.	Salvation has been completed throughout all of the timeline	0

pain in the ass	I once caught him rip a vent off of the front counter where our ice machine was housed, that was a pain in the ass to put back on	A little back story:  There was a family that always came into the family owned restaurant I used to work at.  The family always consisted of the dad, son, and another grown man (maybe brother to the dad, we never found out).  The mother had never seen, but the dad had a wedding ring and always threatened the kid with 'You better act right or your mother will not be happy!'  The sad part, the kid had down syndrome we think (no one was a professional), the older man could not speak, and the dad was just kind of out there.  This family, or half family, whatever you want to call it, would always come in 7-10 times a week, sometimes 2 times a day, and spend no less than $40 when they would order food.  The kid would always go nuts wanting something whenever he walked in the door and would be throwing and slamming shit all over the place.  Right after the dad would pay I would be giving him the change and the kid would see the change and the receipt and start yelling "I WANT MONEY!!" and absolutely go ape shit!  The first few times were hilarious as fuck, but after about 2 weeks of them coming in we started to get tired of the shit because it wasn't like they were the only ones in the restaurant at all.  (We were at the point to where we were like you want money?  Come over here and ill shove a fucking roll of quarters down your throat so you shut the fuck up!)  We constantly had other customers asking how much longer for their food, run out the door, and leave as fast as possible.  The kid at one point was getting so bad that he would take the trays, throw and slam them against the booths or whatever was closest for him to destroy.  The real turning point was the day that, well first was violently shaking and about to break the candy machine when I yelled at him to cut it out, then he came over to the counter and grabbed the pin pad, and started slamming it against the counter.  Like this kid had no boundaries of what he wouldn't do.  I once caught him rip a vent off of the front counter where our ice machine was housed, that was a pain in the ass to put back on.  It got to the point where one of us had to go babysit the kid so he wouldn't fuck anything up, not to mention this was while we were busy too.  The owner finally got fed up with it and banned them from coming back.  The dad was furious at us and even the mom called saying she was going to sue us for discriminating against her mentally challenged son.  Pretty much he did not care.  About 4 or 5 months later, nothing happened so it was just a bluff.  A couple of saw these people around at other restaurants and the kid still acted the same and no mother was ever around.  I have not seen them since this, but they are now some other restaurants problem.Now I still feel like a piece of shit for making fun of the kid, but it was seriously some of the funniest shit I had ever seen.

hit the nail on the head	I think you hit the nail on the head	I think you hit the nail on the head... when talking about contemporary Americans. It a very narcissistic culture of close-minded self-certainty. Essentially if you were to meet a decent, honest, open-minded, thoughtful person, they would almost certainly respond to you (and even your insults) in a way that was satisfactory and that would likely lead to increased understanding for you both.On the other hand, you write like you are 16 which means that people are likely going to dismiss what you say based on the context, regardless of how much sense you make.If by any chance you are 16ish, that is great!  You have your whole life ahead of you.  One simple lesson to learn is that the people closest to you, and especially the ones you love, will say (and believe) shit that blows your mind and makes you lose all faith in humanity for the sheer stupidity, meanness, and ignorance involved.  This will make you doubt humanity.  Solution: Unknown.  Workaround: Make sure the friends you make are not the kind of fools that you are ranting about.  (Fools, yes, but fun and funny fools.)

in light of	But, like I said, in light of my experiences, for me it would be illogical not to have faith	Thanks for the excellent advice. Here is his reply. Putting it in text so you can quote if you need to. Counter-counters! :) And I don't like not being able to press enter to make this all organized.... .........1. We KNOW something we call "gravity" exists, but we have FAITH that it'll be in effect when we wake up in the morning. Obviously, this is a pretty safe leap of faith, but just saying. Evolution has evidence, yes, but it's holey evidence. If my lineage cannot be traced back to a monkey strictly empirically, saying that I evolved from a monkey is a leap of faith. Yeah, saying I evolved from a monkey makes logical sense, considering the premises of evolution, but just because something is logical, doesn't mean it is true. Science has yet to prove macroevolution. There's a good case for it... but there's a better case for God, I believe. The evidence for God, for me, would be the fact we exist. Nothing comes from nothing, all that. In any case, we certainly didn't evolve into existence. And why existence, rather than non-existence? All those fun questions. This doesn't prove anything, and it's circular, but- would there be scientific evidence for the God who created science? Fun question, I think. .............2. Atheists have faith that God doesn't exist, based on their notions of what existence means or is. I don't mean to say they have a supernatural faith, but rather that they have faith in a set of beliefs that shape how they view the world. Atheistic beliefs. Basically- that God doesn't exist, even though they can't prove that. Atheist faith. .............3. Right. But the fact that the turmoil leads them to cling tightly to God can't rule the possibility of God out, either. That would be a double standard, and unfair. They do need something to believe in, desperately. We all do. They have found it, due largely to their circumstances. I wouldn't say God is tearing apart His faithful- although, if He were, we wouldn't be in a position to cast judgement on Him, He's God- I would say He is using the terrible situations to bring them closer to Him. "Working for their good," as we Christians would say. The perception that God punishes is an inaccurate one, I think. I think it is certainly in His power to do so, but Jesus' life was a message of grace, forgiveness, mercy, etc. The world is screwed up, but that's hardly God's fault. We live here. ................4. I didn't mean that faith is superior, although some do. I just meant that I wasn't trying to provide a rational/logical basis for my faith. You simply can't do that, all the way. Finite logic ends at some point, and you have to make a faith leap. Or I do, anyway. But, like I said, in light of my experiences, for me it would be illogical not to have faith.I see the errors already but I'm going to hold off on replying until the last couple of drinks I had wear off.	But, like I said, because of my experiences, for me it would be illogical not to have faith	1

pain in the ass	I once caught him rip a vent off of the front counter where our ice machine was housed, that was a pain in the ass to put back on	A little back story:  There was a family that always came into the family owned restaurant I used to work at.  The family always consisted of the dad, son, and another grown man (maybe brother to the dad, we never found out).  The mother had never seen, but the dad had a wedding ring and always threatened the kid with 'You better act right or your mother will not be happy!'  The sad part, the kid had down syndrome we think (no one was a professional), the older man could not speak, and the dad was just kind of out there.  This family, or half family, whatever you want to call it, would always come in 7-10 times a week, sometimes 2 times a day, and spend no less than $40 when they would order food.  The kid would always go nuts wanting something whenever he walked in the door and would be throwing and slamming shit all over the place.  Right after the dad would pay I would be giving him the change and the kid would see the change and the receipt and start yelling "I WANT MONEY!!" and absolutely go ape shit!  The first few times were hilarious as fuck, but after about 2 weeks of them coming in we started to get tired of the shit because it wasn't like they were the only ones in the restaurant at all.  (We were at the point to where we were like you want money?  Come over here and ill shove a fucking roll of quarters down your throat so you shut the fuck up!)  We constantly had other customers asking how much longer for their food, run out the door, and leave as fast as possible.  The kid at one point was getting so bad that he would take the trays, throw and slam them against the booths or whatever was closest for him to destroy.  The real turning point was the day that, well first was violently shaking and about to break the candy machine when I yelled at him to cut it out, then he came over to the counter and grabbed the pin pad, and started slamming it against the counter.  Like this kid had no boundaries of what he wouldn't do.  I once caught him rip a vent off of the front counter where our ice machine was housed, that was a pain in the ass to put back on.  It got to the point where one of us had to go babysit the kid so he wouldn't fuck anything up, not to mention this was while we were busy too.  The owner finally got fed up with it and banned them from coming back.  The dad was furious at us and even the mom called saying she was going to sue us for discriminating against her mentally challenged son.  Pretty much he did not care.  About 4 or 5 months later, nothing happened so it was just a bluff.  A couple of saw these people around at other restaurants and the kid still acted the same and no mother was ever around.  I have not seen them since this, but they are now some other restaurants problem.Now I still feel like a piece of shit for making fun of the kid, but it was seriously some of the funniest shit I had ever seen.

on the right track	I think you're on the right track for first version antennas	Outstanding!   Don't worry too much about damaging the transmitter in the FT-840, you would have to do something unique and unexpected to fool the power amplifier protection circuit into letting you damage it with just poor load match while tuning. You may find the Astron RS-20 a bit light for your station, most hams I speak to say that it's true that Astron supplies will make their rated current, but only briefly. If you plan to do any modes that require long transmissions at high power, the RS-20 will make a nice heater until it fails... the rule of thumb that I use with Astrons is less than 1/2 rated current if you are going to run continuous load, and let it rest a while if it's getting uncomfortable to touch it. For CW and SSB, have at it until the supply overheats, then listen around the band for a while. I think you're on the right track for first version antennas. My "utility" antenna is a 450 ohm ladder line to a "dipole" rigged as an inverted V, with the apex 90 feet up my tower, 70 foot "legs", and the ends dragged out to make the "V" angle about 90 degrees..... it ain't as good as the Steppir that's above it, but very handy. Your adjustable impedance matching device will fix (or hide) your impedance matching problem. Loops are also a handy choice for wire antennas, if you plan to just use the tuner to fix the "random" impedance, longer is better (to a point). Purpose built loops and dipoles have remarkably good performance for being simple wires.... I'm especially fond of 66 foot loops for the 20 meter band.... an equilateral triangular loop, 1 wavelength around, held up at the apex, with the "corners" staked out tight, with the base about 10 feet above the ground.... feed it in the middle of the base with a simple BalUn .... the feed impedance will be about 100 ohms.... use 1/4 wavelength of 75 ohm TV coax to transform to 50 ohms, then any length of 50 ohm cable to get to the radio, no tuner required .... "cut length" half wave dipoles are easy too, and require no tuner..... at 100 watts and HF, cheap coax (RG-58) is good enough for Jazz.... for reasonable distances.... maybe 100 feet or so..... as you move "up band" loss becomes a problem with cheap coax..... start thinking about cable loss above 21 MHz.... think hard about coax at 144 MHz...... for the overachieving computer geek, antenna simulation software is readily available for cheap.... Start here http://www.eznec.com/  download the demo... play with the example antennas..... when you run out of space in the demo, send W7EL his money for the full program.... when you get good at antenna simulation complain that EZNEC is too limited.... spend BIG money on commercial simulator :-)..... 100 watts and a simple (well considered) antenna will do lots of HF radio for you... Life is too short for QRP, 100 watts on HF is good place to start, ham radio sucks if you make no contacts because nobody hears you... 1.5KW and a beam is better!.. QRP is the ham radio equivalent to fly fishing, expect to be hungry.... no matter how long you fool around with antennas you will never be satisfied, there's always a better one to build next week.... Talk to as many other hams as possible about antennas, don't believe most of what they say, use what they say to start your own investigation, make up your own mind about what's "right". Any group of 5 hams will have 7 different opinions about all subjects...... 73 / VRY GOOD DX OM DE WB7RSG	I think you'r wrong for first version antennas	0

out of thin air	Whatever the encoding or compression, 10Mbps is 10Mbps; you're not going to create information out of thin air further down the line	On the contrary, I think the theoretical maximum bandwidths are fascinating from an engineering standpoint. Whatever the encoding or compression, 10Mbps is 10Mbps; you're not going to create information out of thin air further down the line.Sure, you're not going to reverse-engineer windows by knowing how much data your HDMI cable can carry, and it might not even help you figure out how many pixels the monitor has.

take a stand	I've pointed out what all religions have in common, and that this consistently leads to immorality; I think you'll find it hard to take a stand for any well regarded set of secular moral principles and then show any religion achieving those principles better than a purely non-religious practice of those same principles	&gt; This entirely depends on one accepting the basic premise that utilitarianism is better than any other moral theory, religious or otherwise.Please don't misunderstand me: I pulled up my own favorite moral system as an example close to hand. Society is certainly still discussing what the best system could be, and what it entails. Kant's Categorical Imperative is also in the running, though I'm not sure its applicability is broad enough to stand alone. I'm happy to base my argument on whatever modern and widely supported moral system you prefer - I'll trust your good judgment here.&gt; Your view of religion is, I would say, flawed in some respects. Though we can look at the Abrahamic religions as having these qualities, and indeed some other ones as well, there is no reason to think that religion requires one to "defend their beliefs" against all comers.There absolutely is. No religion that fails to do this survives. None. Though you're strawmanning a bit when you paraphrase me as "defending against all comers." The more important defense is against apostasy, i.e. against "goers." You can even do without that, if you're at least aggressively evangelic. But a religion without injunctions for capturing in its population is bound to fail. This is not base and simplistic, it is universal. Show me a functioning religion that neither advertises, nor indoctrinates its children, nor discourages people from leaving!I'm sorry you misunderstood my ticket anecdote. I failed to defend my car, and this turns out to have been illegal - I fell afoul of my society's moral standards."Virtue" is just another name for "morals" or isn't it? Yes, pacifism might not be immoral under different systems of morality. Maybe I shouldn't have ventured into this aside, I just wanted to show that it's a mistake to think that pacifists are automatically the more moral.&gt; What I am saying is that it's unjustified to paint all religion under one broad stroke.You absolutely haven't shown this. I've pointed out what all religions have in common, and that this consistently leads to immorality; I think you'll find it hard to take a stand for any well regarded set of secular moral principles and then show any religion achieving those principles better than a purely non-religious practice of those same principles.

I always assumed I'd move back after a few years.Now: My mom is moving up here tomorrow, because even with medicare, she can't *ever* afford to retire if she stays in the states, even though the cost of living is actually much higher up here, and she's already 67. She's Canadian, but she's lived in the US for the past 37 years, and is leaving all her friends and other family behind.More telling, my older brother, also duel, and a conservative christian, is moving up here in about 9 months. He's a born again, ex-Bush W. supporting republican, who got laid-off, worked on the Obama campaign, and now is bailing back to the homeland, too (he was 5 years old when we moved to the US... I was 0). He realized about a year ago that if he stayed in the US there is basically no hope for a future for either he or his family (he has a wife and 2 kids).  the US has moved way too far away from even his values, and voting Democrat doesn't help. It seems like even if there were only 9 Republicans in the House of Reps, and 1 in the Senate, they would still get everything they demanded... an end to environmental protections, security and care for those in mansions and gated communities, and shit-soup for everyone else.As for me, like I said, I'd always planned to go back to the US eventually, but, fuck it, I'm done. Every time I vote in Canada, even now after all these years, it's so refreshing to just mark an "X" in the circle by the name, and drop it into the box. No voting machines, no "hanging chads", no questions about registration (not registered? show up to the polls with an ID and a piece of mail with your address... that's it), no bullshit. I don't like Stephen Harper at all, but at least I know the Torys were legitimately elected, and at this point, they're still to the left of the madness of even the Dems in the US.From up here, it looks less and less like the US is in decline, and more and more like it's on the brink of all-out collapse.tl;dr: to answer your question, no, i don't think so at all.

along the lines	Something along the lines of "meat is made out of animals	I have a 4 y/o that is mostly veggie. We explained it to her in an age appropriate way. Something along the lines of "meat is made out of animals. an animal has to die for a person to eat its meat." She understands that animals have feelings, and I have commented to her before about how beautiful the cows are (at the county fair or in a field) and how it's sad that some people eat them. That being said we don't brain wash her and have been careful to point out that people can choose to eat animals if they want just like we choose not to eat them. She was on a bit of a "grandma do you know that chicken is made out of an animal" judgmental sounding kick for a few months when she first found out but is better about it now.She does like to eat some meat. She will order bacon at a restaurant for breakfast, and she will sometimes ask me to get her ham sliced at the deli for her daycare lunch. But she is well aware that those items are made out of an animal and she chooses to eat them. It's rare and may be only one to two times a month that she does. But she has the option. I do not prepare meat for her at home, however. I will buy deli ham but that is it. She eats what we eat for dinners/lunches/etc.TLDR: gently and age appropriately explain your reasons for being veggie and allow the kiddo to make choices. At the very least their choices will come from an informed place.	Something in the nearby lines of "meat is made out of animals	0

hit the nail on the head	I think you hit the nail on the head	I think you hit the nail on the head... when talking about contemporary Americans. It a very narcissistic culture of close-minded self-certainty. Essentially if you were to meet a decent, honest, open-minded, thoughtful person, they would almost certainly respond to you (and even your insults) in a way that was satisfactory and that would likely lead to increased understanding for you both.On the other hand, you write like you are 16 which means that people are likely going to dismiss what you say based on the context, regardless of how much sense you make.If by any chance you are 16ish, that is great!  You have your whole life ahead of you.  One simple lesson to learn is that the people closest to you, and especially the ones you love, will say (and believe) shit that blows your mind and makes you lose all faith in humanity for the sheer stupidity, meanness, and ignorance involved.  This will make you doubt humanity.  Solution: Unknown.  Workaround: Make sure the friends you make are not the kind of fools that you are ranting about.  (Fools, yes, but fun and funny fools.)

out of pocket	Her total cost out of pocket?  Roughly $240 - one of her anti-rejection medications isn't covered (an antibiotic), and it costs us about $10 a month	Canadian:Fantastic.

out of nowhere	She wasn't thinking about your best interests when she ended it out of nowhere, so don't think of her best interests	I haven't been through a divorce but I did live with someone for 6 years who, out of the blue, dumped me, stole a bunch of money from me, and basically acted like the entire time we were together never happened.I pondered and pondered why this happened, why me, etc. Until one day I realized that you can't rationalize crazy. So if someone does some crazy shit, there is no sense trying to figure it out because it will *never* make sense. I won't lie. It hurt for a long time. But now I almost never think about it and my life is much, much better. I really felt my feelings though, if that makes sense. If I felt bad, I felt bad. I just let myself go thru the process of grieving as long as I needed.Don't spend too much time alone. Lean on your friends and family. That is what they are there for. Don't let your ex manipulate you into doing things you don't want to do. If you can, have a friend or family member act as an advisor to you because I can guarantee you are not thinking clearly now (which is normal). Don't move out "just to be nice" or "make things easy". She will just use you until there is nothing left. She wasn't thinking about your best interests when she ended it out of nowhere, so don't think of her best interests. Think of YOUR best interests.I'm sorry you are going thru this. It'll get better.

take a stand	I've pointed out what all religions have in common, and that this consistently leads to immorality; I think you'll find it hard to take a stand for any well regarded set of secular moral principles and then show any religion achieving those principles better than a purely non-religious practice of those same principles	&gt; This entirely depends on one accepting the basic premise that utilitarianism is better than any other moral theory, religious or otherwise.Please don't misunderstand me: I pulled up my own favorite moral system as an example close to hand. Society is certainly still discussing what the best system could be, and what it entails. Kant's Categorical Imperative is also in the running, though I'm not sure its applicability is broad enough to stand alone. I'm happy to base my argument on whatever modern and widely supported moral system you prefer - I'll trust your good judgment here.&gt; Your view of religion is, I would say, flawed in some respects. Though we can look at the Abrahamic religions as having these qualities, and indeed some other ones as well, there is no reason to think that religion requires one to "defend their beliefs" against all comers.There absolutely is. No religion that fails to do this survives. None. Though you're strawmanning a bit when you paraphrase me as "defending against all comers." The more important defense is against apostasy, i.e. against "goers." You can even do without that, if you're at least aggressively evangelic. But a religion without injunctions for capturing in its population is bound to fail. This is not base and simplistic, it is universal. Show me a functioning religion that neither advertises, nor indoctrinates its children, nor discourages people from leaving!I'm sorry you misunderstood my ticket anecdote. I failed to defend my car, and this turns out to have been illegal - I fell afoul of my society's moral standards."Virtue" is just another name for "morals" or isn't it? Yes, pacifism might not be immoral under different systems of morality. Maybe I shouldn't have ventured into this aside, I just wanted to show that it's a mistake to think that pacifists are automatically the more moral.&gt; What I am saying is that it's unjustified to paint all religion under one broad stroke.You absolutely haven't shown this. I've pointed out what all religions have in common, and that this consistently leads to immorality; I think you'll find it hard to take a stand for any well regarded set of secular moral principles and then show any religion achieving those principles better than a purely non-religious practice of those same principles.

come to mind	No drugstore products come to mind other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is	Stick foundations are a lot heavier and can be more challenging to use while learning to blend them out evening. They are mainly used for people who need really full to maximum coverage. I have heard that they can be more pore-clogging yes, generally because they are heavier, and the people who often use them need to use a lot, or a thick layer. If you're spot-covering though, it may be fine. As for the second question, it all depends on the formula of the product. Bobbi Brown and Shisedo both make a great stick foundation, though they're expensive (around $40 each). No drugstore products come to mind other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is. You may want to try a cream-to-powder or cream foundation (in a compact, something like Covergirl's Aquasmooth or Maybelline Dream Smooth Mousse) if you're interested in that sort of coverage/finish. They both work really well for redness.	Besides Max Factor, I can't think of any drugstore products, but I'm not sure how that one is	1

on the right track	I think you're on the right track for first version antennas	Outstanding!   Don't worry too much about damaging the transmitter in the FT-840, you would have to do something unique and unexpected to fool the power amplifier protection circuit into letting you damage it with just poor load match while tuning. You may find the Astron RS-20 a bit light for your station, most hams I speak to say that it's true that Astron supplies will make their rated current, but only briefly. If you plan to do any modes that require long transmissions at high power, the RS-20 will make a nice heater until it fails... the rule of thumb that I use with Astrons is less than 1/2 rated current if you are going to run continuous load, and let it rest a while if it's getting uncomfortable to touch it. For CW and SSB, have at it until the supply overheats, then listen around the band for a while. I think you're on the right track for first version antennas. My "utility" antenna is a 450 ohm ladder line to a "dipole" rigged as an inverted V, with the apex 90 feet up my tower, 70 foot "legs", and the ends dragged out to make the "V" angle about 90 degrees..... it ain't as good as the Steppir that's above it, but very handy. Your adjustable impedance matching device will fix (or hide) your impedance matching problem. Loops are also a handy choice for wire antennas, if you plan to just use the tuner to fix the "random" impedance, longer is better (to a point). Purpose built loops and dipoles have remarkably good performance for being simple wires.... I'm especially fond of 66 foot loops for the 20 meter band.... an equilateral triangular loop, 1 wavelength around, held up at the apex, with the "corners" staked out tight, with the base about 10 feet above the ground.... feed it in the middle of the base with a simple BalUn .... the feed impedance will be about 100 ohms.... use 1/4 wavelength of 75 ohm TV coax to transform to 50 ohms, then any length of 50 ohm cable to get to the radio, no tuner required .... "cut length" half wave dipoles are easy too, and require no tuner..... at 100 watts and HF, cheap coax (RG-58) is good enough for Jazz.... for reasonable distances.... maybe 100 feet or so..... as you move "up band" loss becomes a problem with cheap coax..... start thinking about cable loss above 21 MHz.... think hard about coax at 144 MHz...... for the overachieving computer geek, antenna simulation software is readily available for cheap.... Start here http://www.eznec.com/  download the demo... play with the example antennas..... when you run out of space in the demo, send W7EL his money for the full program.... when you get good at antenna simulation complain that EZNEC is too limited.... spend BIG money on commercial simulator :-)..... 100 watts and a simple (well considered) antenna will do lots of HF radio for you... Life is too short for QRP, 100 watts on HF is good place to start, ham radio sucks if you make no contacts because nobody hears you... 1.5KW and a beam is better!.. QRP is the ham radio equivalent to fly fishing, expect to be hungry.... no matter how long you fool around with antennas you will never be satisfied, there's always a better one to build next week.... Talk to as many other hams as possible about antennas, don't believe most of what they say, use what they say to start your own investigation, make up your own mind about what's "right". Any group of 5 hams will have 7 different opinions about all subjects...... 73 / VRY GOOD DX OM DE WB7RSG	I think you'r wrong for first version antennas	0

Explain to her that this is not the way you wanted to impregnate her and that you want it to be a mutual situation. You love her. You want to trust her. Tell her that you guys can "take care of it" together and a couple years down the road, have a beautiful baby that you are prepared for, together. Otherwise, you will have to leave her for being deceitful. She will love that you want to be with her forever. As soon as she's out of the surgery room, dump that crazy bitch and warn every man's penis in town. She'll thank you when she matures. That, or murder you...probably murder.

pay the bills	It was just a part time job, but I got it to pay the bills until something better came up	I just moved to New York, and got a job at a store in the mall. It was just a part time job, but I got it to pay the bills until something better came up. I ended up getting the job, but was never put on the schedule. I have since found a better job and, as far as I know, I still have that job at the mall. I called the manager multiple times, went into the store, and texted even, all with no response. I decided I'd wait to see if he called and asked where I was.  It has been a month.	It was just a part time job, but I pay the bills until something better came up	0
on the same page	The odds of two people really being on the same page aren't all that great	I think being promiscuous is a bad thing. Sex has a nasty tendency of having a bunch of emotions tied to it. The odds of two people really being on the same page aren't all that great. So you're taking on the risk of one or two people getting hurt in the process of being vulnerable and open, and possibly hindering their ability to develop happy sexual relationships in the future. Do some people manage to have happy slutty lifestyles without hurting others? Well of course. Is it risky (in the sense of risking pregnancy, STDs and heartbreak)? Obviously. IMO in a macroeconomic sense the benefits don't outweigh the costs.	The odds of two people really having different opinions isn't all that great	0

down the line	I wasn't expecting this to come up, since I consider such tech much more advanced and further down the line	&gt; we'd have to invent new technology around inserting this synthetic DNA into the nucleus of a human egg cell at efficiencies well above what we're capable of doing now with cloned animals.This seems like the major limitation.  Just how primitive are current methods and what is the next step?  Also, I know we can insert snippets randomly, but don't we have the technology to wholly replace a cell's DNA with a modified version?  Or are we still unable to accurately make individual changes?&gt; As for writing DNA de novo...I wasn't expecting this to come up, since I consider such tech much more advanced and further down the line.

on the same page	) in the first week so you are all on the same page with stuff	Great idea for a post! Here are some of my tips. Just so you know my background, I'm going to be a fourth year CS major and I'm pretty involved on campus.**Places to eat in Westwood*** There are quite a few, the best thing to do if you want to find as many as you can is walk around Westwood with some friends when you're hungry and try to eat at a place most of you haven't tried before.* Here are a few of my favorites: The Stand, Bella Pita, Fat Sals, the taco stand next to fat Sals (good lunch special), Cafe Elysee, Novel Cafe (best hot chocolate in westwood!), In-N-Out, the food court in Whole Foods* There are also food courts around campus like Ackerman, Luvalle, and Northern Lights to try out.**Things you'll forget to bring to school but need*** horcruxer (great name btw) is right on. Extension cords and powerstrips are key (especially for triples). * Along the same lines, ethernet cords may be a good idea. You can get a free wireless router if you're in the dorms, but the wifi isn't as good as being plugged in**Getting involved socially*** If you are hesitant to break into the UCLA community, a good place to get a social footing is your floor. Whether it's door knocking the first week getting to know a lot of people or floor government or even just a small group of people you met and get along with, dorms are a gret social outlet* Also, check out the giant activites fair during zero week. Most clubs should have a table and you can talk to them in a very non-commital manner in case you end up not interested at all. There are so many clubs at UCLA that it's hard to not find something you are interested in with people that have similar interests. Plus, most groups give out free stuff. **Money saving tips*** Use your meal plan wisely.  Between dining halls and places like Rendezvous, Late Night, and Cafe 1919, there is a good amount of variety. Plus, it's already paid for so you may as well use it.* For Engineers (and maybe other majors, not too sure), check out info sessions. It's a great way to learn about a company and get your name out there, plus most if not all of them have some sort of dinner.* Look into used textboks. SO much cheaper.**Best places to study and why*** Quiet places where you can really focus:* Kerkhoff study lounge, Powel, some of the study rooms in the dorms (most are pretty quiet and a pair of good headphones and some soft music cuts out the sound completely), Covel.* Most of these places have other people studying nearby too, which can really help against zoning out and procrastinating* Busy places:   * Kerkhoff patio and coffee house, your floor's louge in the dorms, cafes/coffee houses in westwood, B-Caf, Ackerman   * If you need some background noise, these are all great spots. Plus, they all have coffee and food nearby when you need some energy. **Dorm life*** Get to know the people on your floor. I still have a few really good friends from my first year and it made the transition into college alot easier. * Lay out some basic rules of the room with your roomates (study habits, guests, signs for sexiling, drinking, etc.) in the first week so you are all on the same page with stuff.* Your RA is most likely doesn't want to write people up. It's part of their job. If you do something stupid like drink too much and throw up in the hall, or are exceptionally loud past quiet hours, they have to write you up. That being said, most understand the importance of having a good time, so they'll let small stuff slide.**What NOT to do at UCLA*** Don't forget you are at UCLA as a student. Don't push aside all your work just for new college experiences. As hard as it may be, get (at least some of) your work done before enjoying yourself. Don't repeat my mistakes :)* Anything you don't want to do. You get the chance to start over where most people know nothing about you. The best advice I can give is do what you really want, avoid what you really don't want, and understand and accept the consequences for your actions.* Just to clarify, I'm not saying you should go crazy trying everything you've always wanted to now that you are away from home. Make smart decisions and try new things. If you don't want to do something, don't. Okay, I think I beat that into the ground far enough.**Academic advice*** Find out how you study best. Whether it's notcards, briefly looking over your notes, endlessly doing problem sets, study groups, whatever. That way you can be really efficient with your studying and not be too worried for exams. * Don't put everything off to the last minute. Especially in your first year and when you start taking upper divisions (~third year), the work load may not be what you are used to. And even if you find it easy or not too bad, get it out of the way early so you don't have it looming over you or forget. * Seek help if you need it. TAs and professors have office hours where you can ask them any pressing questions you may have. There are also plenty of outlets for tutoring on campus (Covel may still be doing drop in tutoring, and for engineers, check out TBP, HKN, and UPE's joint tutoring program)* Just like the social aspect of college, the academic side is what you make it. If you want to make academics your secondary reason for college, it's definitely a possibility (though not one I would reccomend). If you want to learn as much as you can, try going to office hours as much as possible in the subjects that interest you. It's a great way for professors to get to know you and you can work on getting a letter of rec or some research opportunities.**Other Advice*** If you are looking for a job on campus, there is a place between Kerkhoff and Ackerman (second floor of Kerkhoff I think...) that has job postings. * Try to find a club or a group with people that you like as soon as possible. For me, it was Unicamp (shameless plug), but there are plenty of organizations out there for all sorts of people.* Try to go to the football and basketball games. We don't have the best teams, but they are fun to watch, especially in the student sections.* Look into exploring LA and downtown as much as possible. The Getty, Third Street, LA Art Walk, Venice, and LACMA are just a few cool places.TL;DRHave fun. College can be one of the best times of your life. To quote Ferris Bueller (oddly fitting for the quarter system too) :"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't slow down and look around, you might miss it"Feel free to ask any other question you may have.**EDIT:** Formating	) in the first week so you are all in agreement with stuff	1

smoke and mirrors	It's always going to be smoke and mirrors, to some extent	In order to use this technology, you'd have to combine both "unlimited detail" voxels with regular polygons. This is actually similar to how games work right now: we can draw VERY detailed content, as long as its static (unchanging). The data can be preprocessed so that all the data structures are in place to do efficient clipping and level-of-detail. Anything that has animation and/or physics applied to it is rendered separately, and less efficiently. But because there's significantly less of it, it works out. For instance, right now you generally don't see real-time deformation and physics applied to the ENTIRE environment, but only to portions of it (one building, certain objects, characters).So, use "unlimited detail" for your terrain and buildings. Then put your normal polygonal skeleton keyframe physics animated entities on top of it.It's always going to be smoke and mirrors, to some extent.	It's always going to be an illusion, to some extent	1
in light of	But, like I said, in light of my experiences, for me it would be illogical not to have faith	Thanks for the excellent advice. Here is his reply. Putting it in text so you can quote if you need to. Counter-counters! :) And I don't like not being able to press enter to make this all organized.... .........1. We KNOW something we call "gravity" exists, but we have FAITH that it'll be in effect when we wake up in the morning. Obviously, this is a pretty safe leap of faith, but just saying. Evolution has evidence, yes, but it's holey evidence. If my lineage cannot be traced back to a monkey strictly empirically, saying that I evolved from a monkey is a leap of faith. Yeah, saying I evolved from a monkey makes logical sense, considering the premises of evolution, but just because something is logical, doesn't mean it is true. Science has yet to prove macroevolution. There's a good case for it... but there's a better case for God, I believe. The evidence for God, for me, would be the fact we exist. Nothing comes from nothing, all that. In any case, we certainly didn't evolve into existence. And why existence, rather than non-existence? All those fun questions. This doesn't prove anything, and it's circular, but- would there be scientific evidence for the God who created science? Fun question, I think. .............2. Atheists have faith that God doesn't exist, based on their notions of what existence means or is. I don't mean to say they have a supernatural faith, but rather that they have faith in a set of beliefs that shape how they view the world. Atheistic beliefs. Basically- that God doesn't exist, even though they can't prove that. Atheist faith. .............3. Right. But the fact that the turmoil leads them to cling tightly to God can't rule the possibility of God out, either. That would be a double standard, and unfair. They do need something to believe in, desperately. We all do. They have found it, due largely to their circumstances. I wouldn't say God is tearing apart His faithful- although, if He were, we wouldn't be in a position to cast judgement on Him, He's God- I would say He is using the terrible situations to bring them closer to Him. "Working for their good," as we Christians would say. The perception that God punishes is an inaccurate one, I think. I think it is certainly in His power to do so, but Jesus' life was a message of grace, forgiveness, mercy, etc. The world is screwed up, but that's hardly God's fault. We live here. ................4. I didn't mean that faith is superior, although some do. I just meant that I wasn't trying to provide a rational/logical basis for my faith. You simply can't do that, all the way. Finite logic ends at some point, and you have to make a faith leap. Or I do, anyway. But, like I said, in light of my experiences, for me it would be illogical not to have faith.I see the errors already but I'm going to hold off on replying until the last couple of drinks I had wear off.	But, like I said, in light for my experiences, for me it would be illogical not to have faith	0

rule of thumb	In general it's a good rule of thumb that if it comes right after a preposition, you should probably use "whom"	In general it's a good rule of thumb that if it comes right after a preposition, you should probably use "whom".   The problem in this case is that "To whoever started this . . . " isn't really a sentence.  You can see that "whoever started this" is a complete noun phrase, into which you can substitute "he" or "him" to see which one sounds right.  You're addressing your letter "to [noun phrase]".As BHSPitMonkey points out tho it really just boils down to whether the mystery person in question is a *subject* (the person *doing* something, in this case "starting this trend") or an *object* (the person that something *is being done to*, as in the letter appellation "to whom it may concern" where "it" is the subject which is doing the action of concerning).Anyway.  When in doubt, go with "who".  You'll get more flack for over-deploying "whom" than you will for under-deploying it.	In general you can rule thumbs that if it comes right after a preposition, you should probably use "whom"	0

change of heart	So I worked it all out, I invited him to a friends place where we could be alone, telling him I had a change of heart	I was in high school and dating this guy who wanted to go "all the way". I told him I wasn't ready (I was pretty conservative) and he promptly went around school telling everyone we "did the deed" (His words, not mine) as well as several other pretty graphic things. He also went to several school counselors and told them I had a few STD's, which caused me to get pulled out of class to be talked to. Some of my teachers were even informed.So I worked it all out, I invited him to a friends place where we could be alone, telling him I had a change of heart. I got him down to his boxers, while I stayed completely clothed. I wrapped myself in a blanket and told him I needed some air on the balcony and wanted him to come with me. Note that we were in an apartment. On the 3rd floor. During an blizzard.In the middle of the night. I had him go first out the door, then promptly yanked the blanket off of him, pulled the sliding glass door shut and locked it.

again and again	My parents were both old school nurses of the 'walk-it-off' mentality, so I walked off that gimpy ankle again and again	Never, at least according to the medical journals. My parents were both old school nurses of the 'walk-it-off' mentality, so I walked off that gimpy ankle again and again. I only visit doctors for penicillin nowadays, but the witch out by the swan lake field says I keep having a gimpy ankle because it was either repetitively sprained or broken while the bone was still growing, and I sure do remember that fucker hurting a lot while I was growing up.  I do consider myself healthy, no scars though I've been hit by cars 3 times in my life, have lopped off half a big toe in a bike wheel, almost been disected by a large falling soccer goal, received multiple full-force smacks to the head by baseball bats, was even dragged after a truck (my clothes got stuck to it while the rest of me didnt - dont think my dad ever even noticed he had been dragging his little kid daughter around after the truck - IMO 'walk it off' meant 'we dont care, theres something better to do, and dont even bother trying to bawl').

in the works	Salvation has been in the works throughout all of the timeline	I think limiting a God who lives outside of time with a timeline may be a bit presumptive on our part. It is the teaching of my Church that the work of Christ extends both backwards and fowards through all time; his incarnation, life, death, and resurrection are the focal point of all history. We also teach that the God that is revealed in the Old Testament is Christ himself before he was born in time as a man. Salvation has been in the works throughout all of the timeline.Regarding salvation for others, we believe Christ conquered death by death on behalf of all. As you put it, he opened the gates of heaven. An Easter hymn of ours says:&gt;Christ is risen from the dead,&gt;Trampling down death by death,&gt;And upon those in the tombs&gt;Bestowing life!We believe we have had to way to God revealed to us through Christ; we say little to nothing about those outside of the Church. "We know where the Church is; we do not know where it is not." This isn't universalism, but it leaves that hope open.	Salvation has been initially throughout all the timeline	0

down the line	I wasn't expecting this to come up, since I consider such tech much more advanced and further down the line	&gt; we'd have to invent new technology around inserting this synthetic DNA into the nucleus of a human egg cell at efficiencies well above what we're capable of doing now with cloned animals.This seems like the major limitation.  Just how primitive are current methods and what is the next step?

along the lines	Something along the lines of "meat is made out of animals	I have a 4 y/o that is mostly veggie. We explained it to her in an age appropriate way. Something along the lines of "meat is made out of animals. an animal has to die for a person to eat its meat." She understands that animals have feelings, and I have commented to her before about how beautiful the cows are (at the county fair or in a field) and how it's sad that some people eat them. That being said we don't brain wash her and have been careful to point out that people can choose to eat animals if they want just like we choose not to eat them. She was on a bit of a "grandma do you know that chicken is made out of an animal" judgmental sounding kick for a few months when she first found out but is better about it now.She does like to eat some meat. She will order bacon at a restaurant for breakfast, and she will sometimes ask me to get her ham sliced at the deli for her daycare lunch. But she is well aware that those items are made out of an animal and she chooses to eat them. It's rare and may be only one to two times a month that she does. But she has the option. I do not prepare meat for her at home, however. I will buy deli ham but that is it. She eats what we eat for dinners/lunches/etc.TLDR: gently and age appropriately explain your reasons for being veggie and allow the kiddo to make choices. At the very least their choices will come from an informed place.	Something like "meat is made out of animals	1

tip of the iceberg	Do you realize what these fuckers have cost us (Wisconsinites) in jobs alone, not to mention tax revenue?!Collective bargaining is just the tip of the iceberg	I think it's a good idea, and I'm downvoting you. Also, I'm not only voting today because of collective bargaining, but because of the body of work the Republicans have done. Their misleading mailers telling people to send in absentee ballots by Thursday (after today's election), their voter registration requirements designed to prevent people from voting, their corporate giveaways to their rich pals, the Kock brothers, their fucking over the entire state on a high speed rail project, their fucking over the entire state on what would have been the largest wind farm. Do you realize what these fuckers have cost us (Wisconsinites) in jobs alone, not to mention tax revenue?!Collective bargaining is just the tip of the iceberg. So don't sit there and pretend Walker is a victim in this. He dug his own grave, as did the Republicans who are up for recall today. I just hope this state has the good sense to throw them all out on their smug asses.Also, the short term results from one school district are hardly representative of an entire state, regardless of what someone's blog and some right-wing rag I've never heard of say (or perhaps one of their top articles "Obamaphiles still longing for Camelot" isn't what I think it is).edit: Downvotes without a single rational argument refuting any of the points mentioned above.

rule of thumb	In general it's a good rule of thumb that if it comes right after a preposition, you should probably use "whom"	In general it's a good rule of thumb that if it comes right after a preposition, you should probably use "whom".   The problem in this case is that "To whoever started this . . . " isn't really a sentence.  You can see that "whoever started this" is a complete noun phrase, into which you can substitute "he" or "him" to see which one sounds right.  You're addressing your letter "to [noun phrase]".As BHSPitMonkey points out tho it really just boils down to whether the mystery person in question is a *subject* (the person *doing* something, in this case "starting this trend") or an *object* (the person that something *is being done to*, as in the letter appellation "to whom it may concern" where "it" is the subject which is doing the action of concerning).Anyway.  When in doubt, go with "who".  You'll get more flack for over-deploying "whom" than you will for under-deploying it.

out of nowhere	She wasn't thinking about your best interests when she ended it out of nowhere, so don't think of her best interests	I haven't been through a divorce but I did live with someone for 6 years who, out of the blue, dumped me, stole a bunch of money from me, and basically acted like the entire time we were together never happened.I pondered and pondered why this happened, why me, etc. Until one day I realized that you can't rationalize crazy. So if someone does some crazy shit, there is no sense trying to figure it out because it will *never* make sense. I won't lie. It hurt for a long time. But now I almost never think about it and my life is much, much better. I really felt my feelings though, if that makes sense. If I felt bad, I felt bad. I just let myself go thru the process of grieving as long as I needed.Don't spend too much time alone. Lean on your friends and family. That is what they are there for. Don't let your ex manipulate you into doing things you don't want to do. If you can, have a friend or family member act as an advisor to you because I can guarantee you are not thinking clearly now (which is normal). Don't move out "just to be nice" or "make things easy". She will just use you until there is nothing left. She wasn't thinking about your best interests when she ended it out of nowhere, so don't think of her best interests.

come to mind	No drugstore products come to mind other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is	Stick foundations are a lot heavier and can be more challenging to use while learning to blend them out evening. They are mainly used for people who need really full to maximum coverage. I have heard that they can be more pore-clogging yes, generally because they are heavier, and the people who often use them need to use a lot, or a thick layer. If you're spot-covering though, it may be fine. As for the second question, it all depends on the formula of the product. Bobbi Brown and Shisedo both make a great stick foundation, though they're expensive (around $40 each). No drugstore products come to mind other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is. You may want to try a cream-to-powder or cream foundation (in a compact, something like Covergirl's Aquasmooth or Maybelline Dream Smooth Mousse) if you're interested in that sort of coverage/finish. They both work really well for redness.	No drugstore products come to skull other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is	0

out of thin air	Whatever the encoding or compression, 10Mbps is 10Mbps; you're not going to create information out of thin air further down the line	On the contrary, I think the theoretical maximum bandwidths are fascinating from an engineering standpoint.

on the right track	I think you're on the right track for first version antennas	Outstanding!   Don't worry too much about damaging the transmitter in the FT-840, you would have to do something unique and unexpected to fool the power amplifier protection circuit into letting you damage it with just poor load match while tuning. You may find the Astron RS-20 a bit light for your station, most hams I speak to say that it's true that Astron supplies will make their rated current, but only briefly. If you plan to do any modes that require long transmissions at high power, the RS-20 will make a nice heater until it fails... the rule of thumb that I use with Astrons is less than 1/2 rated current if you are going to run continuous load, and let it rest a while if it's getting uncomfortable to touch it. For CW and SSB, have at it until the supply overheats, then listen around the band for a while. I think you're on the right track for first version antennas. My "utility" antenna is a 450 ohm ladder line to a "dipole" rigged as an inverted V, with the apex 90 feet up my tower, 70 foot "legs", and the ends dragged out to make the "V" angle about 90 degrees..... it ain't as good as the Steppir that's above it, but very handy. Your adjustable impedance matching device will fix (or hide) your impedance matching problem. Loops are also a handy choice for wire antennas, if you plan to just use the tuner to fix the "random" impedance, longer is better (to a point). Purpose built loops and dipoles have remarkably good performance for being simple wires.... I'm especially fond of 66 foot loops for the 20 meter band.... an equilateral triangular loop, 1 wavelength around, held up at the apex, with the "corners" staked out tight, with the base about 10 feet above the ground.... feed it in the middle of the base with a simple BalUn .... the feed impedance will be about 100 ohms.... use 1/4 wavelength of 75 ohm TV coax to transform to 50 ohms, then any length of 50 ohm cable to get to the radio, no tuner required .... "cut length" half wave dipoles are easy too, and require no tuner..... at 100 watts and HF, cheap coax (RG-58) is good enough for Jazz.... for reasonable distances.... maybe 100 feet or so..... as you move "up band" loss becomes a problem with cheap coax..... start thinking about cable loss above 21 MHz.... think hard about coax at 144 MHz...... for the overachieving computer geek, antenna simulation software is readily available for cheap.... Start here http://www.eznec.com/  download the demo... play with the example antennas..... when you run out of space in the demo, send W7EL his money for the full program.... when you get good at antenna simulation complain that EZNEC is too limited.... spend BIG money on commercial simulator :-)..... 100 watts and a simple (well considered) antenna will do lots of HF radio for you... Life is too short for QRP, 100 watts on HF is good place to start, ham radio sucks if you make no contacts because nobody hears you... 1.5KW and a beam is better!.. QRP is the ham radio equivalent to fly fishing, expect to be hungry.... no matter how long you fool around with antennas you will never be satisfied, there's always a better one to build next week.... Talk to as many other hams as possible about antennas, don't believe most of what they say, use what they say to start your own investigation, make up your own mind about what's "right". Any group of 5 hams will have 7 different opinions about all subjects...... 73 / VRY GOOD DX OM DE WB7RSG	I think you're likley to get the correct solution for first version antennas	1
pain in the ass	I once caught him rip a vent off of the front counter where our ice machine was housed, that was a pain in the ass to put back on	A little back story:  There was a family that always came into the family owned restaurant I used to work at.  The family always consisted of the dad, son, and another grown man (maybe brother to the dad, we never found out).  The mother had never seen, but the dad had a wedding ring and always threatened the kid with 'You better act right or your mother will not be happy!'  The sad part, the kid had down syndrome we think (no one was a professional), the older man could not speak, and the dad was just kind of out there.  This family, or half family, whatever you want to call it, would always come in 7-10 times a week, sometimes 2 times a day, and spend no less than $40 when they would order food.  The kid would always go nuts wanting something whenever he walked in the door and would be throwing and slamming shit all over the place.  Right after the dad would pay I would be giving him the change and the kid would see the change and the receipt and start yelling "I WANT MONEY!!" and absolutely go ape shit!  The first few times were hilarious as fuck, but after about 2 weeks of them coming in we started to get tired of the shit because it wasn't like they were the only ones in the restaurant at all.  (We were at the point to where we were like you want money?  Come over here and ill shove a fucking roll of quarters down your throat so you shut the fuck up!)  We constantly had other customers asking how much longer for their food, run out the door, and leave as fast as possible.  The kid at one point was getting so bad that he would take the trays, throw and slam them against the booths or whatever was closest for him to destroy.  The real turning point was the day that, well first was violently shaking and about to break the candy machine when I yelled at him to cut it out, then he came over to the counter and grabbed the pin pad, and started slamming it against the counter.  Like this kid had no boundaries of what he wouldn't do.  I once caught him rip a vent off of the front counter where our ice machine was housed, that was a pain in the ass to put back on.  It got to the point where one of us had to go babysit the kid so he wouldn't fuck anything up, not to mention this was while we were busy too.  The owner finally got fed up with it and banned them from coming back.  The dad was furious at us and even the mom called saying she was going to sue us for discriminating against her mentally challenged son.  Pretty much he did not care.  About 4 or 5 months later, nothing happened so it was just a bluff.  A couple of saw these people around at other restaurants and the kid still acted the same and no mother was ever around.  I have not seen them since this, but they are now some other restaurants problem.Now I still feel like a piece of shit for making fun of the kid, but it was seriously some of the funniest shit I had ever seen.

I only visit doctors for penicillin nowadays, but the witch out by the swan lake field says I keep having a gimpy ankle because it was either repetitively sprained or broken while the bone was still growing, and I sure do remember that fucker hurting a lot while I was growing up.  I do consider myself healthy, no scars though I've been hit by cars 3 times in my life, have lopped off half a big toe in a bike wheel, almost been disected by a large falling soccer goal, received multiple full-force smacks to the head by baseball bats, was even dragged after a truck (my clothes got stuck to it while the rest of me didnt - dont think my dad ever even noticed he had been dragging his little kid daughter around after the truck - IMO 'walk it off' meant 'we dont care, theres something better to do, and dont even bother trying to bawl').

rule of thumb	In general it's a good rule of thumb that if it comes right after a preposition, you should probably use "whom"	In general it's a good rule of thumb that if it comes right after a preposition, you should probably use "whom".   The problem in this case is that "To whoever started this . . . " isn't really a sentence.  You can see that "whoever started this" is a complete noun phrase, into which you can substitute "he" or "him" to see which one sounds right.  You're addressing your letter "to [noun phrase]".As BHSPitMonkey points out tho it really just boils down to whether the mystery person in question is a *subject* (the person *doing* something, in this case "starting this trend") or an *object* (the person that something *is being done to*, as in the letter appellation "to whom it may concern" where "it" is the subject which is doing the action of concerning).Anyway.  When in doubt, go with "who".  You'll get more flack for over-deploying "whom" than you will for under-deploying it.

in light of	But, like I said, in light of my experiences, for me it would be illogical not to have faith	Thanks for the excellent advice. Here is his reply. Putting it in text so you can quote if you need to. Counter-counters! :) And I don't like not being able to press enter to make this all organized.... .........1. We KNOW something we call "gravity" exists, but we have FAITH that it'll be in effect when we wake up in the morning. Obviously, this is a pretty safe leap of faith, but just saying. Evolution has evidence, yes, but it's holey evidence. If my lineage cannot be traced back to a monkey strictly empirically, saying that I evolved from a monkey is a leap of faith. Yeah, saying I evolved from a monkey makes logical sense, considering the premises of evolution, but just because something is logical, doesn't mean it is true. Science has yet to prove macroevolution. There's a good case for it... but there's a better case for God, I believe. The evidence for God, for me, would be the fact we exist. Nothing comes from nothing, all that. In any case, we certainly didn't evolve into existence. And why existence, rather than non-existence? All those fun questions. This doesn't prove anything, and it's circular, but- would there be scientific evidence for the God who created science? Fun question, I think. .............2. Atheists have faith that God doesn't exist, based on their notions of what existence means or is. I don't mean to say they have a supernatural faith, but rather that they have faith in a set of beliefs that shape how they view the world. Atheistic beliefs. Basically- that God doesn't exist, even though they can't prove that. Atheist faith. .............3. Right. But the fact that the turmoil leads them to cling tightly to God can't rule the possibility of God out, either. That would be a double standard, and unfair. They do need something to believe in, desperately. We all do. They have found it, due largely to their circumstances. I wouldn't say God is tearing apart His faithful- although, if He were, we wouldn't be in a position to cast judgement on Him, He's God- I would say He is using the terrible situations to bring them closer to Him. "Working for their good," as we Christians would say. The perception that God punishes is an inaccurate one, I think. I think it is certainly in His power to do so, but Jesus' life was a message of grace, forgiveness, mercy, etc. The world is screwed up, but that's hardly God's fault. We live here. ................4. I didn't mean that faith is superior, although some do. I just meant that I wasn't trying to provide a rational/logical basis for my faith. You simply can't do that, all the way. Finite logic ends at some point, and you have to make a faith leap. Or I do, anyway. But, like I said, in light of my experiences, for me it would be illogical not to have faith.I see the errors already but I'm going to hold off on replying until the last couple of drinks I had wear off.	But, like I said, independent of my experiences, for me it would be illogical not to have faith	0
on the brink	From up here, it looks less and less like the US is in decline, and more and more like it's on the brink of all-out collapse	I moved to Canada about 10 years ago... lucky enough to be a duel citizen. Part of it was politics; most of it was just for personal reasons--needing a change, getting away, etc... Just like you, i thought that if everyone left but the scumbags, it would just make things worse. I always assumed I'd move back after a few years.Now: My mom is moving up here tomorrow, because even with medicare, she can't *ever* afford to retire if she stays in the states, even though the cost of living is actually much higher up here, and she's already 67. She's Canadian, but she's lived in the US for the past 37 years, and is leaving all her friends and other family behind.More telling, my older brother, also duel, and a conservative christian, is moving up here in about 9 months. He's a born again, ex-Bush W. supporting republican, who got laid-off, worked on the Obama campaign, and now is bailing back to the homeland, too (he was 5 years old when we moved to the US... I was 0). He realized about a year ago that if he stayed in the US there is basically no hope for a future for either he or his family (he has a wife and 2 kids).  the US has moved way too far away from even his values, and voting Democrat doesn't help. It seems like even if there were only 9 Republicans in the House of Reps, and 1 in the Senate, they would still get everything they demanded... an end to environmental protections, security and care for those in mansions and gated communities, and shit-soup for everyone else.As for me, like I said, I'd always planned to go back to the US eventually, but, fuck it, I'm done. Every time I vote in Canada, even now after all these years, it's so refreshing to just mark an "X" in the circle by the name, and drop it into the box. No voting machines, no "hanging chads", no questions about registration (not registered? show up to the polls with an ID and a piece of mail with your address... that's it), no bullshit. I don't like Stephen Harper at all, but at least I know the Torys were legitimately elected, and at this point, they're still to the left of the madness of even the Dems in the US.From up here, it looks less and less like the US is in decline, and more and more like it's on the brink of all-out collapse.tl;dr: to answer your question, no, i don't think so at all.	From up here, it looks less and less like the US is in decline, and more and more like it's very close to all-out collapse	1

come to mind	No drugstore products come to mind other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is	Stick foundations are a lot heavier and can be more challenging to use while learning to blend them out evening. They are mainly used for people who need really full to maximum coverage. I have heard that they can be more pore-clogging yes, generally because they are heavier, and the people who often use them need to use a lot, or a thick layer. If you're spot-covering though, it may be fine. As for the second question, it all depends on the formula of the product. Bobbi Brown and Shisedo both make a great stick foundation, though they're expensive (around $40 each). No drugstore products come to mind other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is. You may want to try a cream-to-powder or cream foundation (in a compact, something like Covergirl's Aquasmooth or Maybelline Dream Smooth Mousse) if you're interested in that sort of coverage/finish. They both work really well for redness.	I can't remeber any drugstore products other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is	1

take a stand	I've pointed out what all religions have in common, and that this consistently leads to immorality; I think you'll find it hard to take a stand for any well regarded set of secular moral principles and then show any religion achieving those principles better than a purely non-religious practice of those same principles	&gt; This entirely depends on one accepting the basic premise that utilitarianism is better than any other moral theory, religious or otherwise.Please don't misunderstand me: I pulled up my own favorite moral system as an example close to hand. Society is certainly still discussing what the best system could be, and what it entails. Kant's Categorical Imperative is also in the running, though I'm not sure its applicability is broad enough to stand alone. I'm happy to base my argument on whatever modern and widely supported moral system you prefer - I'll trust your good judgment here.&gt; Your view of religion is, I would say, flawed in some respects. Though we can look at the Abrahamic religions as having these qualities, and indeed some other ones as well, there is no reason to think that religion requires one to "defend their beliefs" against all comers.There absolutely is. No religion that fails to do this survives. None. Though you're strawmanning a bit when you paraphrase me as "defending against all comers." The more important defense is against apostasy, i.e. against "goers." You can even do without that, if you're at least aggressively evangelic. But a religion without injunctions for capturing in its population is bound to fail. This is not base and simplistic, it is universal. Show me a functioning religion that neither advertises, nor indoctrinates its children, nor discourages people from leaving!I'm sorry you misunderstood my ticket anecdote. I failed to defend my car, and this turns out to have been illegal - I fell afoul of my society's moral standards."Virtue" is just another name for "morals" or isn't it? Yes, pacifism might not be immoral under different systems of morality. Maybe I shouldn't have ventured into this aside, I just wanted to show that it's a mistake to think that pacifists are automatically the more moral.&gt; What I am saying is that it's unjustified to paint all religion under one broad stroke.You absolutely haven't shown this. I've pointed out what all religions have in common, and that this consistently leads to immorality; I think you'll find it hard to take a stand for any well regarded set of secular moral principles and then show any religion achieving those principles better than a purely non-religious practice of those same principles.

smoke and mirrors	It's always going to be smoke and mirrors, to some extent	In order to use this technology, you'd have to combine both "unlimited detail" voxels with regular polygons. This is actually similar to how games work right now: we can draw VERY detailed content, as long as its static (unchanging). The data can be preprocessed so that all the data structures are in place to do efficient clipping and level-of-detail. Anything that has animation and/or physics applied to it is rendered separately, and less efficiently. But because there's significantly less of it, it works out. For instance, right now you generally don't see real-time deformation and physics applied to the ENTIRE environment, but only to portions of it (one building, certain objects, characters).So, use "unlimited detail" for your terrain and buildings. Then put your normal polygonal skeleton keyframe physics animated entities on top of it.It's always going to be smoke and mirrors, to some extent.

on the same page	The odds of two people really being on the same page aren't all that great	I think being promiscuous is a bad thing. Sex has a nasty tendency of having a bunch of emotions tied to it. The odds of two people really being on the same page aren't all that great. So you're taking on the risk of one or two people getting hurt in the process of being vulnerable and open, and possibly hindering their ability to develop happy sexual relationships in the future. Do some people manage to have happy slutty lifestyles without hurting others? Well of course. Is it risky (in the sense of risking pregnancy, STDs and heartbreak)? Obviously. IMO in a macroeconomic sense the benefits don't outweigh the costs.	The odds of two people really being in full agreement isn't all that great	1

tip of the iceberg	Do you realize what these fuckers have cost us (Wisconsinites) in jobs alone, not to mention tax revenue?!Collective bargaining is just the tip of the iceberg	I think it's a good idea, and I'm downvoting you. Also, I'm not only voting today because of collective bargaining, but because of the body of work the Republicans have done. Their misleading mailers telling people to send in absentee ballots by Thursday (after today's election), their voter registration requirements designed to prevent people from voting, their corporate giveaways to their rich pals, the Kock brothers, their fucking over the entire state on a high speed rail project, their fucking over the entire state on what would have been the largest wind farm. Do you realize what these fuckers have cost us (Wisconsinites) in jobs alone, not to mention tax revenue?!Collective bargaining is just the tip of the iceberg. So don't sit there and pretend Walker is a victim in this. He dug his own grave, as did the Republicans who are up for recall today. I just hope this state has the good sense to throw them all out on their smug asses.Also, the short term results from one school district are hardly representative of an entire state, regardless of what someone's blog and some right-wing rag I've never heard of say (or perhaps one of their top articles "Obamaphiles still longing for Camelot" isn't what I think it is).edit: Downvotes without a single rational argument refuting any of the points mentioned above.

in the works	Salvation has been in the works throughout all of the timeline	I think limiting a God who lives outside of time with a timeline may be a bit presumptive on our part.

pain in the ass	I once caught him rip a vent off of the front counter where our ice machine was housed, that was a pain in the ass to put back on	A little back story:  There was a family that always came into the family owned restaurant I used to work at.  The family always consisted of the dad, son, and another grown man (maybe brother to the dad, we never found out).  The mother had never seen, but the dad had a wedding ring and always threatened the kid with 'You better act right or your mother will not be happy!'  The sad part, the kid had down syndrome we think (no one was a professional), the older man could not speak, and the dad was just kind of out there.  This family, or half family, whatever you want to call it, would always come in 7-10 times a week, sometimes 2 times a day, and spend no less than $40 when they would order food.  The kid would always go nuts wanting something whenever he walked in the door and would be throwing and slamming shit all over the place.  Right after the dad would pay I would be giving him the change and the kid would see the change and the receipt and start yelling "I WANT MONEY!!" and absolutely go ape shit!  The first few times were hilarious as fuck, but after about 2 weeks of them coming in we started to get tired of the shit because it wasn't like they were the only ones in the restaurant at all.  (We were at the point to where we were like you want money?  Come over here and ill shove a fucking roll of quarters down your throat so you shut the fuck up!)  We constantly had other customers asking how much longer for their food, run out the door, and leave as fast as possible.  The kid at one point was getting so bad that he would take the trays, throw and slam them against the booths or whatever was closest for him to destroy.  The real turning point was the day that, well first was violently shaking and about to break the candy machine when I yelled at him to cut it out, then he came over to the counter and grabbed the pin pad, and started slamming it against the counter.  Like this kid had no boundaries of what he wouldn't do.  I once caught him rip a vent off of the front counter where our ice machine was housed, that was a pain in the ass to put back on.  It got to the point where one of us had to go babysit the kid so he wouldn't fuck anything up, not to mention this was while we were busy too.  The owner finally got fed up with it and banned them from coming back.  The dad was furious at us and even the mom called saying she was going to sue us for discriminating against her mentally challenged son.  Pretty much he did not care.  About 4 or 5 months later, nothing happened so it was just a bluff.  A couple of saw these people around at other restaurants and the kid still acted the same and no mother was ever around.  I have not seen them since this, but they are now some other restaurants problem.Now I still feel like a piece of shit for making fun of the kid, but it was seriously some of the funniest shit I had ever seen.

rule of thumb	In general it's a good rule of thumb that if it comes right after a preposition, you should probably use "whom"	In general it's a good rule of thumb that if it comes right after a preposition, you should probably use "whom".   The problem in this case is that "To whoever started this . . . " isn't really a sentence.  You can see that "whoever started this" is a complete noun phrase, into which you can substitute "he" or "him" to see which one sounds right.  You're addressing your letter "to [noun phrase]".As BHSPitMonkey points out tho it really just boils down to whether the mystery person in question is a *subject* (the person *doing* something, in this case "starting this trend") or an *object* (the person that something *is being done to*, as in the letter appellation "to whom it may concern" where "it" is the subject which is doing the action of concerning).Anyway.  When in doubt, go with "who".  You'll get more flack for over-deploying "whom" than you will for under-deploying it.

with a grain of salt	(Take my input with a grain of salt as I'm just a recently graduated high school senior going to college this year)But seriously, tough situation you have there, and my comment may be a little late	Wow...that's really all I can say..(Take my input with a grain of salt as I'm just a recently graduated high school senior going to college this year)But seriously, tough situation you have there, and my comment may be a little late.  I think it was noble for you to help out your mother, and also to confront her about the conversation that you overheard, but while moving out is a good idea, I think you should still send her some money her way.  I don't mean your entire income, but just enough for her to get by, and apply for any gov't grants available for her situation (like you said, disabled, widowed, etc)  Another thing that you have to do is talk to your sister about what's going to happen as essentially (sorry to put it this way) but you're abandoning your mother.  It should be her turn to take responsibility of your mother, but honestly from reading the description of your family will end up with her (your mother) being abandoned by everyone.  Hopefully everything will work out for you, and you live a great life with your new family.P.S: Your fiance/wife is definitely a keeper, especially if she was willing to put up with you away being away from her and your newborn child.  She clearly knows that family is important and has the right ideals instilled in her.  Just explain your situation as you did hear, and I know everyone will understand why you made those choices.

pain in the ass	I once caught him rip a vent off of the front counter where our ice machine was housed, that was a pain in the ass to put back on	A little back story:  There was a family that always came into the family owned restaurant I used to work at.  The family always consisted of the dad, son, and another grown man (maybe brother to the dad, we never found out).  The mother had never seen, but the dad had a wedding ring and always threatened the kid with 'You better act right or your mother will not be happy!'  The sad part, the kid had down syndrome we think (no one was a professional), the older man could not speak, and the dad was just kind of out there.  This family, or half family, whatever you want to call it, would always come in 7-10 times a week, sometimes 2 times a day, and spend no less than $40 when they would order food.  The kid would always go nuts wanting something whenever he walked in the door and would be throwing and slamming shit all over the place.  Right after the dad would pay I would be giving him the change and the kid would see the change and the receipt and start yelling "I WANT MONEY!!" and absolutely go ape shit!  The first few times were hilarious as fuck, but after about 2 weeks of them coming in we started to get tired of the shit because it wasn't like they were the only ones in the restaurant at all.  (We were at the point to where we were like you want money?  Come over here and ill shove a fucking roll of quarters down your throat so you shut the fuck up!)  We constantly had other customers asking how much longer for their food, run out the door, and leave as fast as possible.  The kid at one point was getting so bad that he would take the trays, throw and slam them against the booths or whatever was closest for him to destroy.  The real turning point was the day that, well first was violently shaking and about to break the candy machine when I yelled at him to cut it out, then he came over to the counter and grabbed the pin pad, and started slamming it against the counter.  Like this kid had no boundaries of what he wouldn't do.  I once caught him rip a vent off of the front counter where our ice machine was housed, that was a pain in the ass to put back on.  It got to the point where one of us had to go babysit the kid so he wouldn't fuck anything up, not to mention this was while we were busy too.  The owner finally got fed up with it and banned them from coming back.  The dad was furious at us and even the mom called saying she was going to sue us for discriminating against her mentally challenged son.  Pretty much he did not care.  About 4 or 5 months later, nothing happened so it was just a bluff.  A couple of saw these people around at other restaurants and the kid still acted the same and no mother was ever around.  I have not seen them since this, but they are now some other restaurants problem.Now I still feel like a piece of shit for making fun of the kid, but it was seriously some of the funniest shit I had ever seen.

out of touch	I watched Milton in action in *The One Percent* and the guy is so far out of touch with reality it's ridiculous	&gt;Where does the .edu link show that?It talks about it in various parts. For example in the '90s transition a few companies prospered while most floundered thus creating a huge income disparity. It's like lifting all boats but the tide only lifted a couple while capsizing most.It also talks specifically about it "The same is true for urban-rural differences. Although urban incomes may be on average twothirds to three-quarters higher than rural incomes, these differences are the source of a relatively small proportion of overall inequality in China."Here's another quote from the link "Moreover, significant differences in the cost of living between urban and rural dampen the raw income differentials."&gt;Potentially. What if as a farmer you worked 15 back-breaking hours of day in the fields and as factory worker you worked 12 hours a day sitting down?Having done both I can assure you that it doesn't work that way. Granted I'm in the US so technological differences play a major part as modern farmers don't work nearly as hard as factory workers. It really depends on the trade-off. Do you want overly repetitious work and to give up your personal freedom for a urban job or take the risk of a bad crop which can break you for a season?Common sense would say that "if both jobs equally suck why move from the farm to the factory in the first place?" The only reason, sending money home. Look at the illegal immigration movement in the US. Why work in Mexico when you can come to the US and make 82 times as much to send home? There's your incentive, it's not because urban factory worker life is better, it's because the income disparity is so great between rural and urban China that the trade-off is worth it. Problem is what happens when those rural areas catch up with the urban ones kind of like it has in the US? Sure farmers will have more cash but the rise wouldn't be enough and everyone will be equally impoverished again. It would also increase turnover in factories by a huge margin. Granted China is manipulating its currency and trying its hardest to keep that from happening by keeping the majority of its citizens impoverished. They don't want to have to compete on a global scale for labor.&gt;Economics is not fact; it is all theory.While mostly true it can be derived from facts. The business cycle is a fact in our current system. We will have recessions and we will have booms. We know what causes both. Speculation is where it gets hairy because it can drastically change economic stability with no facts to justify it. Oil prices rising and falling because of Libya for example.&gt;Which is great, because then it universities would be forced to slash tuition prices to what people can afford without going into subjugating debt.That's against the main principle of capitalism, you just eliminated equality of opportunity because if it worked the way you just described private schools wouldn't cost four times as much as public schools. The schools just cut enrollment to keep the price inflated. Why rely on needing a enrollment of 10,000 students at $10,000 a year when you can just as easily get 5,000 at $20,000 and don't have to build extra facilities and provide extra amenities. Also schools would still be priced out of many poor peoples ranges. Remember a $9500 a year loan isn't enough for most, you really think bring a $10,000 a year public school price down to $2,000 a year is going to matter? You'll alienate a lot of the country that wasn't born with a trust fund.&gt;You obviously didn't check out the links I cited, which document how monopolies were state-created.I watched Milton in action in *The One Percent* and the guy is so far out of touch with reality it's ridiculous. So I tend to avoid opinions coming from economists who ignore facts that shine a negative light on free markets just to promote anti-government rhetoric from a school followed by about 70 economists (either 64 or 74 I can't recall) worldwide that has never had a proven case of ever having a working theory. Austrian school is just one giant confirmation bias circle jerk that got popular because Ron Paul follows it and Objectivist/Anarcho Capitalist eat it up. It's still not taken seriously because of its bias, even Mises acknowledged it is not fact based.Now here's a case where the government has created a monopoly: Bell. They allowed Bell control of the telecommunications expansion to increase growth. This of course ended because they spread across the country and no longer needed massive funds for infrastructure growth. They are reforming naturally now though. We also see this on a micro scale in other forms of power/data transmission due to finite space and a lack of advanced technology to overcome it.Again the monopolies of the 19th century were completely 100% natural due to having no regulation. I'm sorry you can't accept that monopolies can and do form naturally, there's tons of old and recent evidence to prove that. The government did not get involved until Roosevelt went on his trust busting campaign at the start of the 20th century.&gt;The laws aren't being enforced nor is the punishment, as the regulators are captured by the very industries they are supposed to be watching over. Crony capitalism.In a lot of cases yes. I don't think I've disputed that and think I supported by mentioning Chaney and removing big oil from the Clean Air Act (might have said that to someone else). That doesn't mean the system doesn't work, it means people who have accumulated a lot of money bought people in power. There's quite a few ways to fix this, mostly increasing regulation on government itself as our country has outgrown the effectiveness of checks and balances. Too many closed door deals taking place eliminate their usefulness and thus major increases in transparency are needed.It's obviously not that simple and I've got a ton of theories but they mostly revolve around throwing our weight around. The US is the largest consumer market in the world by far and we have a political system designed to allow us to adjust it as needed. We're just too lazy to do anything about it because of our individualistic nature. If it doesn't directly effect us we don't care. It'll take something big before there's a big change, I'm betting on cuts to education and unemployment being what spurs it. Gas jumping to $5-6 a gallon would probably do it too.EDIT: BTW a quick economics lesson. One of the principles of economics which I've mentioned is a Trade-Off. One type of trade-off that is at the forefront is equality or efficiency. You cannot have both, it's not possible. As I've said a truly free market strives on efficiency. That's it, it could care less about equality. This is why mixed economies tend to prosper greatly. They increase equality which grows a large consumer base and thus increases profits for companies. Our currency system is greatly stressing efficiency which is failing as usual. There has to be a balance between those factors for the best system.

on the same page	) in the first week so you are all on the same page with stuff	Great idea for a post! Here are some of my tips. Just so you know my background, I'm going to be a fourth year CS major and I'm pretty involved on campus.**Places to eat in Westwood*** There are quite a few, the best thing to do if you want to find as many as you can is walk around Westwood with some friends when you're hungry and try to eat at a place most of you haven't tried before.* Here are a few of my favorites: The Stand, Bella Pita, Fat Sals, the taco stand next to fat Sals (good lunch special), Cafe Elysee, Novel Cafe (best hot chocolate in westwood!), In-N-Out, the food court in Whole Foods* There are also food courts around campus like Ackerman, Luvalle, and Northern Lights to try out.**Things you'll forget to bring to school but need*** horcruxer (great name btw) is right on. Extension cords and powerstrips are key (especially for triples). * Along the same lines, ethernet cords may be a good idea. You can get a free wireless router if you're in the dorms, but the wifi isn't as good as being plugged in**Getting involved socially*** If you are hesitant to break into the UCLA community, a good place to get a social footing is your floor. Whether it's door knocking the first week getting to know a lot of people or floor government or even just a small group of people you met and get along with, dorms are a gret social outlet* Also, check out the giant activites fair during zero week. Most clubs should have a table and you can talk to them in a very non-commital manner in case you end up not interested at all. There are so many clubs at UCLA that it's hard to not find something you are interested in with people that have similar interests. Plus, most groups give out free stuff. **Money saving tips*** Use your meal plan wisely.  Between dining halls and places like Rendezvous, Late Night, and Cafe 1919, there is a good amount of variety. Plus, it's already paid for so you may as well use it.* For Engineers (and maybe other majors, not too sure), check out info sessions. It's a great way to learn about a company and get your name out there, plus most if not all of them have some sort of dinner.* Look into used textboks. SO much cheaper.**Best places to study and why*** Quiet places where you can really focus:* Kerkhoff study lounge, Powel, some of the study rooms in the dorms (most are pretty quiet and a pair of good headphones and some soft music cuts out the sound completely), Covel.* Most of these places have other people studying nearby too, which can really help against zoning out and procrastinating* Busy places:   * Kerkhoff patio and coffee house, your floor's louge in the dorms, cafes/coffee houses in westwood, B-Caf, Ackerman   * If you need some background noise, these are all great spots. Plus, they all have coffee and food nearby when you need some energy. **Dorm life*** Get to know the people on your floor. I still have a few really good friends from my first year and it made the transition into college alot easier. * Lay out some basic rules of the room with your roomates (study habits, guests, signs for sexiling, drinking, etc.) in the first week so you are all on the same page with stuff.* Your RA is most likely doesn't want to write people up. It's part of their job. If you do something stupid like drink too much and throw up in the hall, or are exceptionally loud past quiet hours, they have to write you up. That being said, most understand the importance of having a good time, so they'll let small stuff slide.**What NOT to do at UCLA*** Don't forget you are at UCLA as a student. Don't push aside all your work just for new college experiences. As hard as it may be, get (at least some of) your work done before enjoying yourself. Don't repeat my mistakes :)* Anything you don't want to do. You get the chance to start over where most people know nothing about you. The best advice I can give is do what you really want, avoid what you really don't want, and understand and accept the consequences for your actions.* Just to clarify, I'm not saying you should go crazy trying everything you've always wanted to now that you are away from home. Make smart decisions and try new things. If you don't want to do something, don't. Okay, I think I beat that into the ground far enough.**Academic advice*** Find out how you study best. Whether it's notcards, briefly looking over your notes, endlessly doing problem sets, study groups, whatever. That way you can be really efficient with your studying and not be too worried for exams. * Don't put everything off to the last minute. Especially in your first year and when you start taking upper divisions (~third year), the work load may not be what you are used to. And even if you find it easy or not too bad, get it out of the way early so you don't have it looming over you or forget. * Seek help if you need it. TAs and professors have office hours where you can ask them any pressing questions you may have. There are also plenty of outlets for tutoring on campus (Covel may still be doing drop in tutoring, and for engineers, check out TBP, HKN, and UPE's joint tutoring program)* Just like the social aspect of college, the academic side is what you make it. If you want to make academics your secondary reason for college, it's definitely a possibility (though not one I would reccomend). If you want to learn as much as you can, try going to office hours as much as possible in the subjects that interest you. It's a great way for professors to get to know you and you can work on getting a letter of rec or some research opportunities.**Other Advice*** If you are looking for a job on campus, there is a place between Kerkhoff and Ackerman (second floor of Kerkhoff I think...) that has job postings. * Try to find a club or a group with people that you like as soon as possible. For me, it was Unicamp (shameless plug), but there are plenty of organizations out there for all sorts of people.* Try to go to the football and basketball games. We don't have the best teams, but they are fun to watch, especially in the student sections.* Look into exploring LA and downtown as much as possible.

out of touch	I watched Milton in action in *The One Percent* and the guy is so far out of touch with reality it's ridiculous	&gt;Where does the .edu link show that?It talks about it in various parts. For example in the '90s transition a few companies prospered while most floundered thus creating a huge income disparity. It's like lifting all boats but the tide only lifted a couple while capsizing most.It also talks specifically about it "The same is true for urban-rural differences. Although urban incomes may be on average twothirds to three-quarters higher than rural incomes, these differences are the source of a relatively small proportion of overall inequality in China."Here's another quote from the link "Moreover, significant differences in the cost of living between urban and rural dampen the raw income differentials."&gt;Potentially. What if as a farmer you worked 15 back-breaking hours of day in the fields and as factory worker you worked 12 hours a day sitting down?Having done both I can assure you that it doesn't work that way. Granted I'm in the US so technological differences play a major part as modern farmers don't work nearly as hard as factory workers. It really depends on the trade-off. Do you want overly repetitious work and to give up your personal freedom for a urban job or take the risk of a bad crop which can break you for a season?Common sense would say that "if both jobs equally suck why move from the farm to the factory in the first place?" The only reason, sending money home. Look at the illegal immigration movement in the US. Why work in Mexico when you can come to the US and make 82 times as much to send home? There's your incentive, it's not because urban factory worker life is better, it's because the income disparity is so great between rural and urban China that the trade-off is worth it. Problem is what happens when those rural areas catch up with the urban ones kind of like it has in the US? Sure farmers will have more cash but the rise wouldn't be enough and everyone will be equally impoverished again. It would also increase turnover in factories by a huge margin. Granted China is manipulating its currency and trying its hardest to keep that from happening by keeping the majority of its citizens impoverished. They don't want to have to compete on a global scale for labor.&gt;Economics is not fact; it is all theory.While mostly true it can be derived from facts. The business cycle is a fact in our current system. We will have recessions and we will have booms. We know what causes both. Speculation is where it gets hairy because it can drastically change economic stability with no facts to justify it. Oil prices rising and falling because of Libya for example.&gt;Which is great, because then it universities would be forced to slash tuition prices to what people can afford without going into subjugating debt.That's against the main principle of capitalism, you just eliminated equality of opportunity because if it worked the way you just described private schools wouldn't cost four times as much as public schools. The schools just cut enrollment to keep the price inflated. Why rely on needing a enrollment of 10,000 students at $10,000 a year when you can just as easily get 5,000 at $20,000 and don't have to build extra facilities and provide extra amenities. Also schools would still be priced out of many poor peoples ranges. Remember a $9500 a year loan isn't enough for most, you really think bring a $10,000 a year public school price down to $2,000 a year is going to matter? You'll alienate a lot of the country that wasn't born with a trust fund.&gt;You obviously didn't check out the links I cited, which document how monopolies were state-created.I watched Milton in action in *The One Percent* and the guy is so far out of touch with reality it's ridiculous. So I tend to avoid opinions coming from economists who ignore facts that shine a negative light on free markets just to promote anti-government rhetoric from a school followed by about 70 economists (either 64 or 74 I can't recall) worldwide that has never had a proven case of ever having a working theory. Austrian school is just one giant confirmation bias circle jerk that got popular because Ron Paul follows it and Objectivist/Anarcho Capitalist eat it up. It's still not taken seriously because of its bias, even Mises acknowledged it is not fact based.Now here's a case where the government has created a monopoly: Bell. They allowed Bell control of the telecommunications expansion to increase growth. This of course ended because they spread across the country and no longer needed massive funds for infrastructure growth. They are reforming naturally now though. We also see this on a micro scale in other forms of power/data transmission due to finite space and a lack of advanced technology to overcome it.Again the monopolies of the 19th century were completely 100% natural due to having no regulation. I'm sorry you can't accept that monopolies can and do form naturally, there's tons of old and recent evidence to prove that. The government did not get involved until Roosevelt went on his trust busting campaign at the start of the 20th century.&gt;The laws aren't being enforced nor is the punishment, as the regulators are captured by the very industries they are supposed to be watching over. Crony capitalism.In a lot of cases yes. I don't think I've disputed that and think I supported by mentioning Chaney and removing big oil from the Clean Air Act (might have said that to someone else). That doesn't mean the system doesn't work, it means people who have accumulated a lot of money bought people in power. There's quite a few ways to fix this, mostly increasing regulation on government itself as our country has outgrown the effectiveness of checks and balances. Too many closed door deals taking place eliminate their usefulness and thus major increases in transparency are needed.It's obviously not that simple and I've got a ton of theories but they mostly revolve around throwing our weight around. The US is the largest consumer market in the world by far and we have a political system designed to allow us to adjust it as needed. We're just too lazy to do anything about it because of our individualistic nature. If it doesn't directly effect us we don't care. It'll take something big before there's a big change, I'm betting on cuts to education and unemployment being what spurs it. Gas jumping to $5-6 a gallon would probably do it too.EDIT: BTW a quick economics lesson. One of the principles of economics which I've mentioned is a Trade-Off. One type of trade-off that is at the forefront is equality or efficiency. You cannot have both, it's not possible. As I've said a truly free market strives on efficiency. That's it, it could care less about equality. This is why mixed economies tend to prosper greatly. They increase equality which grows a large consumer base and thus increases profits for companies. Our currency system is greatly stressing efficiency which is failing as usual. There has to be a balance between those factors for the best system.

down the line	I wasn't expecting this to come up, since I consider such tech much more advanced and further down the line	&gt; we'd have to invent new technology around inserting this synthetic DNA into the nucleus of a human egg cell at efficiencies well above what we're capable of doing now with cloned animals.This seems like the major limitation.  Just how primitive are current methods and what is the next step?  Also, I know we can insert snippets randomly, but don't we have the technology to wholly replace a cell's DNA with a modified version?  Or are we still unable to accurately make individual changes?&gt; As for writing DNA de novo...I wasn't expecting this to come up, since I consider such tech much more advanced and further down the line.

in the works	Salvation has been in the works throughout all of the timeline	I think limiting a God who lives outside of time with a timeline may be a bit presumptive on our part. It is the teaching of my Church that the work of Christ extends both backwards and fowards through all time; his incarnation, life, death, and resurrection are the focal point of all history. We also teach that the God that is revealed in the Old Testament is Christ himself before he was born in time as a man. Salvation has been in the works throughout all of the timeline.Regarding salvation for others, we believe Christ conquered death by death on behalf of all. As you put it, he opened the gates of heaven. An Easter hymn of ours says:&gt;Christ is risen from the dead,&gt;Trampling down death by death,&gt;And upon those in the tombs&gt;Bestowing life!We believe we have had to way to God revealed to us through Christ; we say little to nothing about those outside of the Church. "We know where the Church is; we do not know where it is not." This isn't universalism, but it leaves that hope open.	Salvation has been initially throughout all the timeline	0

pain in the ass	I once caught him rip a vent off of the front counter where our ice machine was housed, that was a pain in the ass to put back on	A little back story:  There was a family that always came into the family owned restaurant I used to work at.  The family always consisted of the dad, son, and another grown man (maybe brother to the dad, we never found out).  The mother had never seen, but the dad had a wedding ring and always threatened the kid with 'You better act right or your mother will not be happy!'  The sad part, the kid had down syndrome we think (no one was a professional), the older man could not speak, and the dad was just kind of out there.  This family, or half family, whatever you want to call it, would always come in 7-10 times a week, sometimes 2 times a day, and spend no less than $40 when they would order food.  The kid would always go nuts wanting something whenever he walked in the door and would be throwing and slamming shit all over the place.  Right after the dad would pay I would be giving him the change and the kid would see the change and the receipt and start yelling "I WANT MONEY!!" and absolutely go ape shit!  The first few times were hilarious as fuck, but after about 2 weeks of them coming in we started to get tired of the shit because it wasn't like they were the only ones in the restaurant at all.  (We were at the point to where we were like you want money?  Come over here and ill shove a fucking roll of quarters down your throat so you shut the fuck up!)  We constantly had other customers asking how much longer for their food, run out the door, and leave as fast as possible.  The kid at one point was getting so bad that he would take the trays, throw and slam them against the booths or whatever was closest for him to destroy.  The real turning point was the day that, well first was violently shaking and about to break the candy machine when I yelled at him to cut it out, then he came over to the counter and grabbed the pin pad, and started slamming it against the counter.  Like this kid had no boundaries of what he wouldn't do.  I once caught him rip a vent off of the front counter where our ice machine was housed, that was a pain in the ass to put back on.  It got to the point where one of us had to go babysit the kid so he wouldn't fuck anything up, not to mention this was while we were busy too.  The owner finally got fed up with it and banned them from coming back.  The dad was furious at us and even the mom called saying she was going to sue us for discriminating against her mentally challenged son.  Pretty much he did not care.  About 4 or 5 months later, nothing happened so it was just a bluff.  A couple of saw these people around at other restaurants and the kid still acted the same and no mother was ever around.  I have not seen them since this, but they are now some other restaurants problem.Now I still feel like a piece of shit for making fun of the kid, but it was seriously some of the funniest shit I had ever seen.

on the right track	I think you're on the right track for first version antennas	Outstanding!   Don't worry too much about damaging the transmitter in the FT-840, you would have to do something unique and unexpected to fool the power amplifier protection circuit into letting you damage it with just poor load match while tuning. You may find the Astron RS-20 a bit light for your station, most hams I speak to say that it's true that Astron supplies will make their rated current, but only briefly. If you plan to do any modes that require long transmissions at high power, the RS-20 will make a nice heater until it fails... the rule of thumb that I use with Astrons is less than 1/2 rated current if you are going to run continuous load, and let it rest a while if it's getting uncomfortable to touch it. For CW and SSB, have at it until the supply overheats, then listen around the band for a while. I think you're on the right track for first version antennas. My "utility" antenna is a 450 ohm ladder line to a "dipole" rigged as an inverted V, with the apex 90 feet up my tower, 70 foot "legs", and the ends dragged out to make the "V" angle about 90 degrees..... it ain't as good as the Steppir that's above it, but very handy. Your adjustable impedance matching device will fix (or hide) your impedance matching problem. Loops are also a handy choice for wire antennas, if you plan to just use the tuner to fix the "random" impedance, longer is better (to a point). Purpose built loops and dipoles have remarkably good performance for being simple wires.... I'm especially fond of 66 foot loops for the 20 meter band.... an equilateral triangular loop, 1 wavelength around, held up at the apex, with the "corners" staked out tight, with the base about 10 feet above the ground.... feed it in the middle of the base with a simple BalUn .... the feed impedance will be about 100 ohms.... use 1/4 wavelength of 75 ohm TV coax to transform to 50 ohms, then any length of 50 ohm cable to get to the radio, no tuner required .... "cut length" half wave dipoles are easy too, and require no tuner..... at 100 watts and HF, cheap coax (RG-58) is good enough for Jazz.... for reasonable distances.... maybe 100 feet or so..... as you move "up band" loss becomes a problem with cheap coax..... start thinking about cable loss above 21 MHz.... think hard about coax at 144 MHz...... for the overachieving computer geek, antenna simulation software is readily available for cheap.... Start here http://www.eznec.com/  download the demo... play with the example antennas..... when you run out of space in the demo, send W7EL his money for the full program.... when you get good at antenna simulation complain that EZNEC is too limited.... spend BIG money on commercial simulator :-)..... 100 watts and a simple (well considered) antenna will do lots of HF radio for you... Life is too short for QRP, 100 watts on HF is good place to start, ham radio sucks if you make no contacts because nobody hears you... 1.5KW and a beam is better!.. QRP is the ham radio equivalent to fly fishing, expect to be hungry.... no matter how long you fool around with antennas you will never be satisfied, there's always a better one to build next week.... Talk to as many other hams as possible about antennas, don't believe most of what they say, use what they say to start your own investigation, make up your own mind about what's "right". Any group of 5 hams will have 7 different opinions about all subjects...... 73 / VRY GOOD DX OM DE WB7RSG	I think you're working process is correct for first version antennas	1

on the same page	The odds of two people really being on the same page aren't all that great	I think being promiscuous is a bad thing.

So you're taking on the risk of one or two people getting hurt in the process of being vulnerable and open, and possibly hindering their ability to develop happy sexual relationships in the future. Do some people manage to have happy slutty lifestyles without hurting others? Well of course. Is it risky (in the sense of risking pregnancy, STDs and heartbreak)? Obviously.

smoke and mirrors	It's always going to be smoke and mirrors, to some extent	In order to use this technology, you'd have to combine both "unlimited detail" voxels with regular polygons. This is actually similar to how games work right now: we can draw VERY detailed content, as long as its static (unchanging). The data can be preprocessed so that all the data structures are in place to do efficient clipping and level-of-detail. Anything that has animation and/or physics applied to it is rendered separately, and less efficiently. But because there's significantly less of it, it works out. For instance, right now you generally don't see real-time deformation and physics applied to the ENTIRE environment, but only to portions of it (one building, certain objects, characters).So, use "unlimited detail" for your terrain and buildings. Then put your normal polygonal skeleton keyframe physics animated entities on top of it.It's always going to be smoke and mirrors, to some extent.

hit the nail on the head	I think you hit the nail on the head	I think you hit the nail on the head... when talking about contemporary Americans. It a very narcissistic culture of close-minded self-certainty. Essentially if you were to meet a decent, honest, open-minded, thoughtful person, they would almost certainly respond to you (and even your insults) in a way that was satisfactory and that would likely lead to increased understanding for you both.On the other hand, you write like you are 16 which means that people are likely going to dismiss what you say based on the context, regardless of how much sense you make.If by any chance you are 16ish, that is great!  You have your whole life ahead of you.  One simple lesson to learn is that the people closest to you, and especially the ones you love, will say (and believe) shit that blows your mind and makes you lose all faith in humanity for the sheer stupidity, meanness, and ignorance involved.  This will make you doubt humanity.  Solution: Unknown.  Workaround: Make sure the friends you make are not the kind of fools that you are ranting about.  (Fools, yes, but fun and funny fools.)

bells and whistles	He retrained as an anaesthetist and went to work in a big Washington hospital with all the bells and whistles	My uncle used to be a gp (general practitioner) here in the UK in the 80's.

He said that if he ever became terminally sick he would come back here in an instant for good old NHS treatment. That said I have read the Dutch and French systems are more efficient and effective.

get it over with	Then — and I will never forget the look of rage on his face — he screams something about how if we all hate him then he should just get it over with, grabs the edge of the picnic table with both hands, leans way back, and then swings himself forward at full force slamming his face down onto the table top	Many years ago when I was still in Scouts, there was this kid — I'll call him Aaron 'cause that was his fucking name — who was a very strange and somewhat disturbed young man.  He was friendly with my younger brother and they hung out sometimes.  Anyway, we're all hanging out at camp, different groups of kids doing different things, and Aaron, my brother, and a few others are sitting at a picnic table.Everyone was playing cards and Aaron tried to make some play that was invalid (I don't remember what it was, just a move against the rules of whatever game they were playing).  They called him on it and told him that he couldn't do that and he needed to change what he played.  Everyone was being pretty calm about it and just trying to explain that it was against the rules, but apparently Aaron felt that everyone was singling him out or some shit.So, Aaron is getting pretty upset about everything and starts screaming about how everyone hates him and they're always ganging up on him.Then — and I will never forget the look of rage on his face — he screams something about how if we all hate him then he should just get it over with, grabs the edge of the picnic table with both hands, leans way back, and then swings himself forward at full force slamming his face down onto the table top.  He then does this a couple more times before someone manages to stop him.Everyone was completely shocked... I cannot even begin to describe witnessing this event.  Aaron's face is covered with blood, he is screaming about us hating him, sobbing uncontrollably over the pain and humiliation... it was all sorts of fucked up.A few hours later, he was under control, though a bit sedated, and pretty much acted as if the incident hadn't really even occurred.  Everyone was on tip toes around him for months afterwards.

again and again	My parents were both old school nurses of the 'walk-it-off' mentality, so I walked off that gimpy ankle again and again	Never, at least according to the medical journals. My parents were both old school nurses of the 'walk-it-off' mentality, so I walked off that gimpy ankle again and again. I only visit doctors for penicillin nowadays, but the witch out by the swan lake field says I keep having a gimpy ankle because it was either repetitively sprained or broken while the bone was still growing, and I sure do remember that fucker hurting a lot while I was growing up.  I do consider myself healthy, no scars though I've been hit by cars 3 times in my life, have lopped off half a big toe in a bike wheel, almost been disected by a large falling soccer goal, received multiple full-force smacks to the head by baseball bats, was even dragged after a truck (my clothes got stuck to it while the rest of me didnt - dont think my dad ever even noticed he had been dragging his little kid daughter around after the truck - IMO 'walk it off' meant 'we dont care, theres something better to do, and dont even bother trying to bawl').

out of touch	I watched Milton in action in *The One Percent* and the guy is so far out of touch with reality it's ridiculous	&gt;Where does the .edu link show that?It talks about it in various parts. For example in the '90s transition a few companies prospered while most floundered thus creating a huge income disparity. It's like lifting all boats but the tide only lifted a couple while capsizing most.It also talks specifically about it "The same is true for urban-rural differences. Although urban incomes may be on average twothirds to three-quarters higher than rural incomes, these differences are the source of a relatively small proportion of overall inequality in China."Here's another quote from the link "Moreover, significant differences in the cost of living between urban and rural dampen the raw income differentials."&gt;Potentially. What if as a farmer you worked 15 back-breaking hours of day in the fields and as factory worker you worked 12 hours a day sitting down?Having done both I can assure you that it doesn't work that way. Granted I'm in the US so technological differences play a major part as modern farmers don't work nearly as hard as factory workers. It really depends on the trade-off. Do you want overly repetitious work and to give up your personal freedom for a urban job or take the risk of a bad crop which can break you for a season?Common sense would say that "if both jobs equally suck why move from the farm to the factory in the first place?" The only reason, sending money home. Look at the illegal immigration movement in the US. Why work in Mexico when you can come to the US and make 82 times as much to send home? There's your incentive, it's not because urban factory worker life is better, it's because the income disparity is so great between rural and urban China that the trade-off is worth it. Problem is what happens when those rural areas catch up with the urban ones kind of like it has in the US? Sure farmers will have more cash but the rise wouldn't be enough and everyone will be equally impoverished again. It would also increase turnover in factories by a huge margin. Granted China is manipulating its currency and trying its hardest to keep that from happening by keeping the majority of its citizens impoverished. They don't want to have to compete on a global scale for labor.&gt;Economics is not fact; it is all theory.While mostly true it can be derived from facts. The business cycle is a fact in our current system. We will have recessions and we will have booms. We know what causes both. Speculation is where it gets hairy because it can drastically change economic stability with no facts to justify it. Oil prices rising and falling because of Libya for example.&gt;Which is great, because then it universities would be forced to slash tuition prices to what people can afford without going into subjugating debt.That's against the main principle of capitalism, you just eliminated equality of opportunity because if it worked the way you just described private schools wouldn't cost four times as much as public schools. The schools just cut enrollment to keep the price inflated. Why rely on needing a enrollment of 10,000 students at $10,000 a year when you can just as easily get 5,000 at $20,000 and don't have to build extra facilities and provide extra amenities. Also schools would still be priced out of many poor peoples ranges. Remember a $9500 a year loan isn't enough for most, you really think bring a $10,000 a year public school price down to $2,000 a year is going to matter? You'll alienate a lot of the country that wasn't born with a trust fund.&gt;You obviously didn't check out the links I cited, which document how monopolies were state-created.I watched Milton in action in *The One Percent* and the guy is so far out of touch with reality it's ridiculous. So I tend to avoid opinions coming from economists who ignore facts that shine a negative light on free markets just to promote anti-government rhetoric from a school followed by about 70 economists (either 64 or 74 I can't recall) worldwide that has never had a proven case of ever having a working theory. Austrian school is just one giant confirmation bias circle jerk that got popular because Ron Paul follows it and Objectivist/Anarcho Capitalist eat it up. It's still not taken seriously because of its bias, even Mises acknowledged it is not fact based.Now here's a case where the government has created a monopoly: Bell. They allowed Bell control of the telecommunications expansion to increase growth. This of course ended because they spread across the country and no longer needed massive funds for infrastructure growth. They are reforming naturally now though. We also see this on a micro scale in other forms of power/data transmission due to finite space and a lack of advanced technology to overcome it.Again the monopolies of the 19th century were completely 100% natural due to having no regulation. I'm sorry you can't accept that monopolies can and do form naturally, there's tons of old and recent evidence to prove that. The government did not get involved until Roosevelt went on his trust busting campaign at the start of the 20th century.&gt;The laws aren't being enforced nor is the punishment, as the regulators are captured by the very industries they are supposed to be watching over. Crony capitalism.In a lot of cases yes. I don't think I've disputed that and think I supported by mentioning Chaney and removing big oil from the Clean Air Act (might have said that to someone else). That doesn't mean the system doesn't work, it means people who have accumulated a lot of money bought people in power. There's quite a few ways to fix this, mostly increasing regulation on government itself as our country has outgrown the effectiveness of checks and balances. Too many closed door deals taking place eliminate their usefulness and thus major increases in transparency are needed.It's obviously not that simple and I've got a ton of theories but they mostly revolve around throwing our weight around. The US is the largest consumer market in the world by far and we have a political system designed to allow us to adjust it as needed. We're just too lazy to do anything about it because of our individualistic nature. If it doesn't directly effect us we don't care. It'll take something big before there's a big change, I'm betting on cuts to education and unemployment being what spurs it. Gas jumping to $5-6 a gallon would probably do it too.EDIT: BTW a quick economics lesson. One of the principles of economics which I've mentioned is a Trade-Off. One type of trade-off that is at the forefront is equality or efficiency. You cannot have both, it's not possible. As I've said a truly free market strives on efficiency. That's it, it could care less about equality. This is why mixed economies tend to prosper greatly. They increase equality which grows a large consumer base and thus increases profits for companies. Our currency system is greatly stressing efficiency which is failing as usual. There has to be a balance between those factors for the best system.

out of nowhere	She wasn't thinking about your best interests when she ended it out of nowhere, so don't think of her best interests	I haven't been through a divorce but I did live with someone for 6 years who, out of the blue, dumped me, stole a bunch of money from me, and basically acted like the entire time we were together never happened.I pondered and pondered why this happened, why me, etc. Until one day I realized that you can't rationalize crazy. So if someone does some crazy shit, there is no sense trying to figure it out because it will *never* make sense. I won't lie. It hurt for a long time. But now I almost never think about it and my life is much, much better. I really felt my feelings though, if that makes sense. If I felt bad, I felt bad. I just let myself go thru the process of grieving as long as I needed.Don't spend too much time alone. Lean on your friends and family. That is what they are there for. Don't let your ex manipulate you into doing things you don't want to do. If you can, have a friend or family member act as an advisor to you because I can guarantee you are not thinking clearly now (which is normal). Don't move out "just to be nice" or "make things easy". She will just use you until there is nothing left. She wasn't thinking about your best interests when she ended it out of nowhere, so don't think of her best interests.

Too many closed door deals taking place eliminate their usefulness and thus major increases in transparency are needed.It's obviously not that simple and I've got a ton of theories but they mostly revolve around throwing our weight around. The US is the largest consumer market in the world by far and we have a political system designed to allow us to adjust it as needed. We're just too lazy to do anything about it because of our individualistic nature. If it doesn't directly effect us we don't care. It'll take something big before there's a big change, I'm betting on cuts to education and unemployment being what spurs it. Gas jumping to $5-6 a gallon would probably do it too.EDIT: BTW a quick economics lesson. One of the principles of economics which I've mentioned is a Trade-Off. One type of trade-off that is at the forefront is equality or efficiency. You cannot have both, it's not possible. As I've said a truly free market strives on efficiency. That's it, it could care less about equality. This is why mixed economies tend to prosper greatly. They increase equality which grows a large consumer base and thus increases profits for companies. Our currency system is greatly stressing efficiency which is failing as usual. There has to be a balance between those factors for the best system.

on the brink	From up here, it looks less and less like the US is in decline, and more and more like it's on the brink of all-out collapse	I moved to Canada about 10 years ago... lucky enough to be a duel citizen. Part of it was politics; most of it was just for personal reasons--needing a change, getting away, etc... Just like you, i thought that if everyone left but the scumbags, it would just make things worse. I always assumed I'd move back after a few years.Now: My mom is moving up here tomorrow, because even with medicare, she can't *ever* afford to retire if she stays in the states, even though the cost of living is actually much higher up here, and she's already 67. She's Canadian, but she's lived in the US for the past 37 years, and is leaving all her friends and other family behind.More telling, my older brother, also duel, and a conservative christian, is moving up here in about 9 months. He's a born again, ex-Bush W. supporting republican, who got laid-off, worked on the Obama campaign, and now is bailing back to the homeland, too (he was 5 years old when we moved to the US... I was 0). He realized about a year ago that if he stayed in the US there is basically no hope for a future for either he or his family (he has a wife and 2 kids).  the US has moved way too far away from even his values, and voting Democrat doesn't help. It seems like even if there were only 9 Republicans in the House of Reps, and 1 in the Senate, they would still get everything they demanded... an end to environmental protections, security and care for those in mansions and gated communities, and shit-soup for everyone else.As for me, like I said, I'd always planned to go back to the US eventually, but, fuck it, I'm done. Every time I vote in Canada, even now after all these years, it's so refreshing to just mark an "X" in the circle by the name, and drop it into the box. No voting machines, no "hanging chads", no questions about registration (not registered? show up to the polls with an ID and a piece of mail with your address... that's it), no bullshit. I don't like Stephen Harper at all, but at least I know the Torys were legitimately elected, and at this point, they're still to the left of the madness of even the Dems in the US.From up here, it looks less and less like the US is in decline, and more and more like it's on the brink of all-out collapse.tl;dr: to answer your question, no, i don't think so at all.

along the lines	Something along the lines of "meat is made out of animals	I have a 4 y/o that is mostly veggie. We explained it to her in an age appropriate way. Something along the lines of "meat is made out of animals. an animal has to die for a person to eat its meat." She understands that animals have feelings, and I have commented to her before about how beautiful the cows are (at the county fair or in a field) and how it's sad that some people eat them. That being said we don't brain wash her and have been careful to point out that people can choose to eat animals if they want just like we choose not to eat them. She was on a bit of a "grandma do you know that chicken is made out of an animal" judgmental sounding kick for a few months when she first found out but is better about it now.She does like to eat some meat. She will order bacon at a restaurant for breakfast, and she will sometimes ask me to get her ham sliced at the deli for her daycare lunch. But she is well aware that those items are made out of an animal and she chooses to eat them. It's rare and may be only one to two times a month that she does. But she has the option. I do not prepare meat for her at home, however. I will buy deli ham but that is it.

He was friendly with my younger brother and they hung out sometimes.  Anyway, we're all hanging out at camp, different groups of kids doing different things, and Aaron, my brother, and a few others are sitting at a picnic table.Everyone was playing cards and Aaron tried to make some play that was invalid (I don't remember what it was, just a move against the rules of whatever game they were playing).  They called him on it and told him that he couldn't do that and he needed to change what he played.  Everyone was being pretty calm about it and just trying to explain that it was against the rules, but apparently Aaron felt that everyone was singling him out or some shit.So, Aaron is getting pretty upset about everything and starts screaming about how everyone hates him and they're always ganging up on him.Then — and I will never forget the look of rage on his face — he screams something about how if we all hate him then he should just get it over with, grabs the edge of the picnic table with both hands, leans way back, and then swings himself forward at full force slamming his face down onto the table top.  He then does this a couple more times before someone manages to stop him.Everyone was completely shocked... I cannot even begin to describe witnessing this event.  Aaron's face is covered with blood, he is screaming about us hating him, sobbing uncontrollably over the pain and humiliation... it was all sorts of fucked up.A few hours later, he was under control, though a bit sedated, and pretty much acted as if the incident hadn't really even occurred.  Everyone was on tip toes around him for months afterwards.

come to mind	No drugstore products come to mind other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is	Stick foundations are a lot heavier and can be more challenging to use while learning to blend them out evening. They are mainly used for people who need really full to maximum coverage. I have heard that they can be more pore-clogging yes, generally because they are heavier, and the people who often use them need to use a lot, or a thick layer. If you're spot-covering though, it may be fine. As for the second question, it all depends on the formula of the product. Bobbi Brown and Shisedo both make a great stick foundation, though they're expensive (around $40 each). No drugstore products come to mind other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is. You may want to try a cream-to-powder or cream foundation (in a compact, something like Covergirl's Aquasmooth or Maybelline Dream Smooth Mousse) if you're interested in that sort of coverage/finish. They both work really well for redness.	No drugstore products are forgotten other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is	0

However I think you'll find that if you observe the government's immigration policy over the last 5 years, it has vastly improved.

on the same page	The odds of two people really being on the same page aren't all that great	I think being promiscuous is a bad thing. Sex has a nasty tendency of having a bunch of emotions tied to it. The odds of two people really being on the same page aren't all that great. So you're taking on the risk of one or two people getting hurt in the process of being vulnerable and open, and possibly hindering their ability to develop happy sexual relationships in the future. Do some people manage to have happy slutty lifestyles without hurting others? Well of course. Is it risky (in the sense of risking pregnancy, STDs and heartbreak)? Obviously. IMO in a macroeconomic sense the benefits don't outweigh the costs.	The odds of two people really being on the same block isn't all that great	0
out of thin air	Whatever the encoding or compression, 10Mbps is 10Mbps; you're not going to create information out of thin air further down the line	On the contrary, I think the theoretical maximum bandwidths are fascinating from an engineering standpoint. Whatever the encoding or compression, 10Mbps is 10Mbps; you're not going to create information out of thin air further down the line.Sure, you're not going to reverse-engineer windows by knowing how much data your HDMI cable can carry, and it might not even help you figure out how many pixels the monitor has. But if I had to reverse-engineer the HDMI standard, the very first thing I'd want to know is how fast and sensitive I'd need my oscilloscope to be.TLDR: It's not going to give you a lot of insight into anything else, but bandwidth is bandwidth, and saying "10 Mbps at most" is a lot more informative than just leaving it at "we don't use bytes".

in the works	Salvation has been in the works throughout all of the timeline	I think limiting a God who lives outside of time with a timeline may be a bit presumptive on our part. It is the teaching of my Church that the work of Christ extends both backwards and fowards through all time; his incarnation, life, death, and resurrection are the focal point of all history. We also teach that the God that is revealed in the Old Testament is Christ himself before he was born in time as a man. Salvation has been in the works throughout all of the timeline.Regarding salvation for others, we believe Christ conquered death by death on behalf of all. As you put it, he opened the gates of heaven. An Easter hymn of ours says:&gt;Christ is risen from the dead,&gt;Trampling down death by death,&gt;And upon those in the tombs&gt;Bestowing life!We believe we have had to way to God revealed to us through Christ; we say little to nothing about those outside of the Church. "We know where the Church is; we do not know where it is not." This isn't universalism, but it leaves that hope open.	Salvation has been in the process throughout all of the timeline	1

tip of the iceberg	Do you realize what these fuckers have cost us (Wisconsinites) in jobs alone, not to mention tax revenue?!Collective bargaining is just the tip of the iceberg	I think it's a good idea, and I'm downvoting you. Also, I'm not only voting today because of collective bargaining, but because of the body of work the Republicans have done. Their misleading mailers telling people to send in absentee ballots by Thursday (after today's election), their voter registration requirements designed to prevent people from voting, their corporate giveaways to their rich pals, the Kock brothers, their fucking over the entire state on a high speed rail project, their fucking over the entire state on what would have been the largest wind farm.

Whether it's door knocking the first week getting to know a lot of people or floor government or even just a small group of people you met and get along with, dorms are a gret social outlet* Also, check out the giant activites fair during zero week. Most clubs should have a table and you can talk to them in a very non-commital manner in case you end up not interested at all. There are so many clubs at UCLA that it's hard to not find something you are interested in with people that have similar interests. Plus, most groups give out free stuff. **Money saving tips*** Use your meal plan wisely.  Between dining halls and places like Rendezvous, Late Night, and Cafe 1919, there is a good amount of variety. Plus, it's already paid for so you may as well use it.* For Engineers (and maybe other majors, not too sure), check out info sessions. It's a great way to learn about a company and get your name out there, plus most if not all of them have some sort of dinner.* Look into used textboks. SO much cheaper.**Best places to study and why*** Quiet places where you can really focus:* Kerkhoff study lounge, Powel, some of the study rooms in the dorms (most are pretty quiet and a pair of good headphones and some soft music cuts out the sound completely), Covel.* Most of these places have other people studying nearby too, which can really help against zoning out and procrastinating* Busy places:   * Kerkhoff patio and coffee house, your floor's louge in the dorms, cafes/coffee houses in westwood, B-Caf, Ackerman   * If you need some background noise, these are all great spots. Plus, they all have coffee and food nearby when you need some energy. **Dorm life*** Get to know the people on your floor. I still have a few really good friends from my first year and it made the transition into college alot easier. * Lay out some basic rules of the room with your roomates (study habits, guests, signs for sexiling, drinking, etc.) in the first week so you are all on the same page with stuff.* Your RA is most likely doesn't want to write people up. It's part of their job. If you do something stupid like drink too much and throw up in the hall, or are exceptionally loud past quiet hours, they have to write you up. That being said, most understand the importance of having a good time, so they'll let small stuff slide.**What NOT to do at UCLA*** Don't forget you are at UCLA as a student. Don't push aside all your work just for new college experiences. As hard as it may be, get (at least some of) your work done before enjoying yourself. Don't repeat my mistakes :)* Anything you don't want to do. You get the chance to start over where most people know nothing about you. The best advice I can give is do what you really want, avoid what you really don't want, and understand and accept the consequences for your actions.* Just to clarify, I'm not saying you should go crazy trying everything you've always wanted to now that you are away from home. Make smart decisions and try new things. If you don't want to do something, don't. Okay, I think I beat that into the ground far enough.**Academic advice*** Find out how you study best. Whether it's notcards, briefly looking over your notes, endlessly doing problem sets, study groups, whatever. That way you can be really efficient with your studying and not be too worried for exams. * Don't put everything off to the last minute. Especially in your first year and when you start taking upper divisions (~third year), the work load may not be what you are used to. And even if you find it easy or not too bad, get it out of the way early so you don't have it looming over you or forget. * Seek help if you need it. TAs and professors have office hours where you can ask them any pressing questions you may have. There are also plenty of outlets for tutoring on campus (Covel may still be doing drop in tutoring, and for engineers, check out TBP, HKN, and UPE's joint tutoring program)* Just like the social aspect of college, the academic side is what you make it. If you want to make academics your secondary reason for college, it's definitely a possibility (though not one I would reccomend). If you want to learn as much as you can, try going to office hours as much as possible in the subjects that interest you. It's a great way for professors to get to know you and you can work on getting a letter of rec or some research opportunities.**Other Advice*** If you are looking for a job on campus, there is a place between Kerkhoff and Ackerman (second floor of Kerkhoff I think...) that has job postings. * Try to find a club or a group with people that you like as soon as possible. For me, it was Unicamp (shameless plug), but there are plenty of organizations out there for all sorts of people.* Try to go to the football and basketball games. We don't have the best teams, but they are fun to watch, especially in the student sections.* Look into exploring LA and downtown as much as possible. The Getty, Third Street, LA Art Walk, Venice, and LACMA are just a few cool places.TL;DRHave fun. College can be one of the best times of your life.

along the lines	Something along the lines of "meat is made out of animals	I have a 4 y/o that is mostly veggie. We explained it to her in an age appropriate way. Something along the lines of "meat is made out of animals. an animal has to die for a person to eat its meat." She understands that animals have feelings, and I have commented to her before about how beautiful the cows are (at the county fair or in a field) and how it's sad that some people eat them. That being said we don't brain wash her and have been careful to point out that people can choose to eat animals if they want just like we choose not to eat them. She was on a bit of a "grandma do you know that chicken is made out of an animal" judgmental sounding kick for a few months when she first found out but is better about it now.She does like to eat some meat. She will order bacon at a restaurant for breakfast, and she will sometimes ask me to get her ham sliced at the deli for her daycare lunch. But she is well aware that those items are made out of an animal and she chooses to eat them. It's rare and may be only one to two times a month that she does. But she has the option. I do not prepare meat for her at home, however. I will buy deli ham but that is it. She eats what we eat for dinners/lunches/etc.TLDR: gently and age appropriately explain your reasons for being veggie and allow the kiddo to make choices. At the very least their choices will come from an informed place.	Something in the nearby lines of "meat is made out of animals	0

jump to conclusions	These are generally the most productive immigrants in Canada, however the immigration system as a whole is a net benefit to Canada and one shouldn't jump to conclusions about any of the categories	I think you're mixing things up here. There's no '*economic refugee*' status, it's actually [economic immigration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Canada#Immigration_categories). These are generally the most productive immigrants in Canada, however the immigration system as a whole is a net benefit to Canada and one shouldn't jump to conclusions about any of the categories.Immigrants generally pay the same amount of taxes and receive the same amount of government services as Canadians who were born here ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_immigration_to_Canada#Government_finances)); and because we don't have a replacement birthrate, immigration is key to circumventing many demographic challenges that Canada will face in the near future.As for our refugee system, there are serious problems with those who would circumvent the intention of the system. However I think you'll find that if you observe the government's immigration policy over the last 5 years, it has vastly improved.

pain in the butt	The only pain in the butt was the steroid treatment that they put me on for months after leaving the hospital	Dude I had an ITP at your same age, platelets at 6K - scary stuff (I am 36 now).

Steroids mess with your body in interesting ways, in my case I swelled up, needed only 3 or 4 hours of sleep at night, and needed to take like 2-3 showers a day because my skin felt oily and I hated it.

out of the blue	What's your reaction when some coincidence like that hits? And what's your favorite story along those lines of a player hitting big on something out of the blue?	Mkay, my question comes with a story:In New Orleans 6 years ago, my wife and I walked into Harrah's and went to the roulette table. A running joke we have is that whenever my wife walks up to a table, the 6 comes up, and it's always too soon or too late for me to bet. So I plunked $20 on the 6 as my first bet, before the ball was in motion. There were 4 other players. I asked how the table was running, and they said it was a glacier. Of course, the next spin hit the 6. I will never forget the look on that croupier's face: He gave me a stone-cold look, checking to see if I'd somehow cheated.

come to mind	No drugstore products come to mind other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is	Stick foundations are a lot heavier and can be more challenging to use while learning to blend them out evening. They are mainly used for people who need really full to maximum coverage. I have heard that they can be more pore-clogging yes, generally because they are heavier, and the people who often use them need to use a lot, or a thick layer. If you're spot-covering though, it may be fine. As for the second question, it all depends on the formula of the product. Bobbi Brown and Shisedo both make a great stick foundation, though they're expensive (around $40 each). No drugstore products come to mind other than Max Factor, but I'm not sure how that one is.

shoulder to cry on	That distance could be physical (moving out), or it could be emotional -- best thing you can do? Stop letting her use your shoulder to cry on	&gt; I'm worried about being friendzoned though.You are **totally** friend zoned already. You confessed your feelings to the girl, and she told you what she **didn't** want. That's a rejection.&gt; how she wishes she could meet somebody like me.And despite how that sounds, she's not actually talking about you. This is something a girl tells her friend -- she doesn't want you, she wants someone **like** you, except someone she's fully attracted to.Girls also don't seek boy advice from guys they're interested in. The advice on how to get over her is perfectly good though -- you need to give yourself distance, much like a breakup, so you can stop basing the friendship on romantic feelings and base it on platonic feelings instead. That distance could be physical (moving out), or it could be emotional -- best thing you can do? Stop letting her use your shoulder to cry on. Distance yourself from her relationships.

take a stand	I've pointed out what all religions have in common, and that this consistently leads to immorality; I think you'll find it hard to take a stand for any well regarded set of secular moral principles and then show any religion achieving those principles better than a purely non-religious practice of those same principles	&gt; This entirely depends on one accepting the basic premise that utilitarianism is better than any other moral theory, religious or otherwise.Please don't misunderstand me: I pulled up my own favorite moral system as an example close to hand. Society is certainly still discussing what the best system could be, and what it entails. Kant's Categorical Imperative is also in the running, though I'm not sure its applicability is broad enough to stand alone. I'm happy to base my argument on whatever modern and widely supported moral system you prefer - I'll trust your good judgment here.&gt; Your view of religion is, I would say, flawed in some respects. Though we can look at the Abrahamic religions as having these qualities, and indeed some other ones as well, there is no reason to think that religion requires one to "defend their beliefs" against all comers.There absolutely is. No religion that fails to do this survives. None. Though you're strawmanning a bit when you paraphrase me as "defending against all comers." The more important defense is against apostasy, i.e. against "goers." You can even do without that, if you're at least aggressively evangelic. But a religion without injunctions for capturing in its population is bound to fail. This is not base and simplistic, it is universal. Show me a functioning religion that neither advertises, nor indoctrinates its children, nor discourages people from leaving!I'm sorry you misunderstood my ticket anecdote. I failed to defend my car, and this turns out to have been illegal - I fell afoul of my society's moral standards."Virtue" is just another name for "morals" or isn't it? Yes, pacifism might not be immoral under different systems of morality. Maybe I shouldn't have ventured into this aside, I just wanted to show that it's a mistake to think that pacifists are automatically the more moral.&gt; What I am saying is that it's unjustified to paint all religion under one broad stroke.You absolutely haven't shown this. I've pointed out what all religions have in common, and that this consistently leads to immorality; I think you'll find it hard to take a stand for any well regarded set of secular moral principles and then show any religion achieving those principles better than a purely non-religious practice of those same principles.

out of touch	I watched Milton in action in *The One Percent* and the guy is so far out of touch with reality it's ridiculous	&gt;Where does the .edu link show that?It talks about it in various parts. For example in the '90s transition a few companies prospered while most floundered thus creating a huge income disparity. It's like lifting all boats but the tide only lifted a couple while capsizing most.It also talks specifically about it "The same is true for urban-rural differences. Although urban incomes may be on average twothirds to three-quarters higher than rural incomes, these differences are the source of a relatively small proportion of overall inequality in China."Here's another quote from the link "Moreover, significant differences in the cost of living between urban and rural dampen the raw income differentials."&gt;Potentially. What if as a farmer you worked 15 back-breaking hours of day in the fields and as factory worker you worked 12 hours a day sitting down?Having done both I can assure you that it doesn't work that way. Granted I'm in the US so technological differences play a major part as modern farmers don't work nearly as hard as factory workers. It really depends on the trade-off. Do you want overly repetitious work and to give up your personal freedom for a urban job or take the risk of a bad crop which can break you for a season?Common sense would say that "if both jobs equally suck why move from the farm to the factory in the first place?" The only reason, sending money home. Look at the illegal immigration movement in the US. Why work in Mexico when you can come to the US and make 82 times as much to send home? There's your incentive, it's not because urban factory worker life is better, it's because the income disparity is so great between rural and urban China that the trade-off is worth it. Problem is what happens when those rural areas catch up with the urban ones kind of like it has in the US? Sure farmers will have more cash but the rise wouldn't be enough and everyone will be equally impoverished again. It would also increase turnover in factories by a huge margin. Granted China is manipulating its currency and trying its hardest to keep that from happening by keeping the majority of its citizens impoverished. They don't want to have to compete on a global scale for labor.&gt;Economics is not fact; it is all theory.While mostly true it can be derived from facts. The business cycle is a fact in our current system. We will have recessions and we will have booms. We know what causes both. Speculation is where it gets hairy because it can drastically change economic stability with no facts to justify it. Oil prices rising and falling because of Libya for example.&gt;Which is great, because then it universities would be forced to slash tuition prices to what people can afford without going into subjugating debt.That's against the main principle of capitalism, you just eliminated equality of opportunity because if it worked the way you just described private schools wouldn't cost four times as much as public schools. The schools just cut enrollment to keep the price inflated. Why rely on needing a enrollment of 10,000 students at $10,000 a year when you can just as easily get 5,000 at $20,000 and don't have to build extra facilities and provide extra amenities. Also schools would still be priced out of many poor peoples ranges. Remember a $9500 a year loan isn't enough for most, you really think bring a $10,000 a year public school price down to $2,000 a year is going to matter? You'll alienate a lot of the country that wasn't born with a trust fund.&gt;You obviously didn't check out the links I cited, which document how monopolies were state-created.I watched Milton in action in *The One Percent* and the guy is so far out of touch with reality it's ridiculous. So I tend to avoid opinions coming from economists who ignore facts that shine a negative light on free markets just to promote anti-government rhetoric from a school followed by about 70 economists (either 64 or 74 I can't recall) worldwide that has never had a proven case of ever having a working theory. Austrian school is just one giant confirmation bias circle jerk that got popular because Ron Paul follows it and Objectivist/Anarcho Capitalist eat it up. It's still not taken seriously because of its bias, even Mises acknowledged it is not fact based.Now here's a case where the government has created a monopoly: Bell. They allowed Bell control of the telecommunications expansion to increase growth. This of course ended because they spread across the country and no longer needed massive funds for infrastructure growth. They are reforming naturally now though. We also see this on a micro scale in other forms of power/data transmission due to finite space and a lack of advanced technology to overcome it.Again the monopolies of the 19th century were completely 100% natural due to having no regulation. I'm sorry you can't accept that monopolies can and do form naturally, there's tons of old and recent evidence to prove that. The government did not get involved until Roosevelt went on his trust busting campaign at the start of the 20th century.&gt;The laws aren't being enforced nor is the punishment, as the regulators are captured by the very industries they are supposed to be watching over. Crony capitalism.In a lot of cases yes. I don't think I've disputed that and think I supported by mentioning Chaney and removing big oil from the Clean Air Act (might have said that to someone else). That doesn't mean the system doesn't work, it means people who have accumulated a lot of money bought people in power. There's quite a few ways to fix this, mostly increasing regulation on government itself as our country has outgrown the effectiveness of checks and balances. Too many closed door deals taking place eliminate their usefulness and thus major increases in transparency are needed.It's obviously not that simple and I've got a ton of theories but they mostly revolve around throwing our weight around. The US is the largest consumer market in the world by far and we have a political system designed to allow us to adjust it as needed. We're just too lazy to do anything about it because of our individualistic nature. If it doesn't directly effect us we don't care. It'll take something big before there's a big change, I'm betting on cuts to education and unemployment being what spurs it. Gas jumping to $5-6 a gallon would probably do it too.EDIT: BTW a quick economics lesson. One of the principles of economics which I've mentioned is a Trade-Off. One type of trade-off that is at the forefront is equality or efficiency. You cannot have both, it's not possible. As I've said a truly free market strives on efficiency. That's it, it could care less about equality. This is why mixed economies tend to prosper greatly. They increase equality which grows a large consumer base and thus increases profits for companies. Our currency system is greatly stressing efficiency which is failing as usual. There has to be a balance between those factors for the best system.

break the cycle	The world will never break the cycle of famine and tribal war in places like Somalia without breaking the desperate subsistence economy urge to procreate so that at least some kids survive to be future support for their parents and grandparents	The main reason one in ten Somali children will be dead by November is that five in ten of them should not have been born in the first place.The world will never break the cycle of famine and tribal war in places like Somalia without breaking the desperate subsistence economy urge to procreate so that at least some kids survive to be future support for their parents and grandparents. The best thing you can donate to Somalia for a better life for future generations is condoms. Simply feeding the present generation to non-starvation levels to become future parents is ignoring and continuing the real problem.The next best thing would be a total embargo on supply of ammunition. Of course, that's a pipe-dream. So return to the first suggestion.

jump to conclusions	These are generally the most productive immigrants in Canada, however the immigration system as a whole is a net benefit to Canada and one shouldn't jump to conclusions about any of the categories	I think you're mixing things up here.

These are generally the most productive immigrants in Canada, however the immigration system as a whole is a net benefit to Canada and one shouldn't jump to conclusions about any of the categories.Immigrants generally pay the same amount of taxes and receive the same amount of government services as Canadians who were born here ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_immigration_to_Canada#Government_finances)); and because we don't have a replacement birthrate, immigration is key to circumventing many demographic challenges that Canada will face in the near future.As for our refugee system, there are serious problems with those who would circumvent the intention of the system. However I think you'll find that if you observe the government's immigration policy over the last 5 years, it has vastly improved.

with a grain of salt	(Take my input with a grain of salt as I'm just a recently graduated high school senior going to college this year)But seriously, tough situation you have there, and my comment may be a little late	Wow...that's really all I can say..(Take my input with a grain of salt as I'm just a recently graduated high school senior going to college this year)But seriously, tough situation you have there, and my comment may be a little late.  I think it was noble for you to help out your mother, and also to confront her about the conversation that you overheard, but while moving out is a good idea, I think you should still send her some money her way.  I don't mean your entire income, but just enough for her to get by, and apply for any gov't grants available for her situation (like you said, disabled, widowed, etc)  Another thing that you have to do is talk to your sister about what's going to happen as essentially (sorry to put it this way) but you're abandoning your mother.  It should be her turn to take responsibility of your mother, but honestly from reading the description of your family will end up with her (your mother) being abandoned by everyone.  Hopefully everything will work out for you, and you live a great life with your new family.P.S: Your fiance/wife is definitely a keeper, especially if she was willing to put up with you away being away from her and your newborn child.  She clearly knows that family is important and has the right ideals instilled in her.  Just explain your situation as you did hear, and I know everyone will understand why you made those choices.

take a stand	I've pointed out what all religions have in common, and that this consistently leads to immorality; I think you'll find it hard to take a stand for any well regarded set of secular moral principles and then show any religion achieving those principles better than a purely non-religious practice of those same principles	&gt; This entirely depends on one accepting the basic premise that utilitarianism is better than any other moral theory, religious or otherwise.Please don't misunderstand me: I pulled up my own favorite moral system as an example close to hand. Society is certainly still discussing what the best system could be, and what it entails. Kant's Categorical Imperative is also in the running, though I'm not sure its applicability is broad enough to stand alone. I'm happy to base my argument on whatever modern and widely supported moral system you prefer - I'll trust your good judgment here.&gt; Your view of religion is, I would say, flawed in some respects. Though we can look at the Abrahamic religions as having these qualities, and indeed some other ones as well, there is no reason to think that religion requires one to "defend their beliefs" against all comers.There absolutely is. No religion that fails to do this survives. None. Though you're strawmanning a bit when you paraphrase me as "defending against all comers." The more important defense is against apostasy, i.e. against "goers." You can even do without that, if you're at least aggressively evangelic. But a religion without injunctions for capturing in its population is bound to fail. This is not base and simplistic, it is universal. Show me a functioning religion that neither advertises, nor indoctrinates its children, nor discourages people from leaving!I'm sorry you misunderstood my ticket anecdote. I failed to defend my car, and this turns out to have been illegal - I fell afoul of my society's moral standards."Virtue" is just another name for "morals" or isn't it? Yes, pacifism might not be immoral under different systems of morality. Maybe I shouldn't have ventured into this aside, I just wanted to show that it's a mistake to think that pacifists are automatically the more moral.&gt; What I am saying is that it's unjustified to paint all religion under one broad stroke.You absolutely haven't shown this. I've pointed out what all religions have in common, and that this consistently leads to immorality; I think you'll find it hard to take a stand for any well regarded set of secular moral principles and then show any religion achieving those principles better than a purely non-religious practice of those same principles.

in light of	But, like I said, in light of my experiences, for me it would be illogical not to have faith	Thanks for the excellent advice. Here is his reply. Putting it in text so you can quote if you need to. Counter-counters! :) And I don't like not being able to press enter to make this all organized.... .........1. We KNOW something we call "gravity" exists, but we have FAITH that it'll be in effect when we wake up in the morning. Obviously, this is a pretty safe leap of faith, but just saying. Evolution has evidence, yes, but it's holey evidence. If my lineage cannot be traced back to a monkey strictly empirically, saying that I evolved from a monkey is a leap of faith. Yeah, saying I evolved from a monkey makes logical sense, considering the premises of evolution, but just because something is logical, doesn't mean it is true. Science has yet to prove macroevolution. There's a good case for it... but there's a better case for God, I believe. The evidence for God, for me, would be the fact we exist. Nothing comes from nothing, all that. In any case, we certainly didn't evolve into existence. And why existence, rather than non-existence? All those fun questions. This doesn't prove anything, and it's circular, but- would there be scientific evidence for the God who created science? Fun question, I think. .............2. Atheists have faith that God doesn't exist, based on their notions of what existence means or is. I don't mean to say they have a supernatural faith, but rather that they have faith in a set of beliefs that shape how they view the world. Atheistic beliefs. Basically- that God doesn't exist, even though they can't prove that. Atheist faith. .............3. Right. But the fact that the turmoil leads them to cling tightly to God can't rule the possibility of God out, either. That would be a double standard, and unfair. They do need something to believe in, desperately. We all do. They have found it, due largely to their circumstances. I wouldn't say God is tearing apart His faithful- although, if He were, we wouldn't be in a position to cast judgement on Him, He's God- I would say He is using the terrible situations to bring them closer to Him. "Working for their good," as we Christians would say. The perception that God punishes is an inaccurate one, I think. I think it is certainly in His power to do so, but Jesus' life was a message of grace, forgiveness, mercy, etc. The world is screwed up, but that's hardly God's fault. We live here. ................4. I didn't mean that faith is superior, although some do. I just meant that I wasn't trying to provide a rational/logical basis for my faith. You simply can't do that, all the way. Finite logic ends at some point, and you have to make a faith leap. Or I do, anyway. But, like I said, in light of my experiences, for me it would be illogical not to have faith.I see the errors already but I'm going to hold off on replying until the last couple of drinks I had wear off.	But, like I said, in light for my experiences, for me it would be illogical not to have faith	0

on the right track	I think you're on the right track for first version antennas	Outstanding!   Don't worry too much about damaging the transmitter in the FT-840, you would have to do something unique and unexpected to fool the power amplifier protection circuit into letting you damage it with just poor load match while tuning. You may find the Astron RS-20 a bit light for your station, most hams I speak to say that it's true that Astron supplies will make their rated current, but only briefly. If you plan to do any modes that require long transmissions at high power, the RS-20 will make a nice heater until it fails... the rule of thumb that I use with Astrons is less than 1/2 rated current if you are going to run continuous load, and let it rest a while if it's getting uncomfortable to touch it. For CW and SSB, have at it until the supply overheats, then listen around the band for a while. I think you're on the right track for first version antennas. My "utility" antenna is a 450 ohm ladder line to a "dipole" rigged as an inverted V, with the apex 90 feet up my tower, 70 foot "legs", and the ends dragged out to make the "V" angle about 90 degrees..... it ain't as good as the Steppir that's above it, but very handy. Your adjustable impedance matching device will fix (or hide) your impedance matching problem. Loops are also a handy choice for wire antennas, if you plan to just use the tuner to fix the "random" impedance, longer is better (to a point). Purpose built loops and dipoles have remarkably good performance for being simple wires.... I'm especially fond of 66 foot loops for the 20 meter band.... an equilateral triangular loop, 1 wavelength around, held up at the apex, with the "corners" staked out tight, with the base about 10 feet above the ground.... feed it in the middle of the base with a simple BalUn .... the feed impedance will be about 100 ohms.... use 1/4 wavelength of 75 ohm TV coax to transform to 50 ohms, then any length of 50 ohm cable to get to the radio, no tuner required .... "cut length" half wave dipoles are easy too, and require no tuner..... at 100 watts and HF, cheap coax (RG-58) is good enough for Jazz.... for reasonable distances.... maybe 100 feet or so..... as you move "up band" loss becomes a problem with cheap coax..... start thinking about cable loss above 21 MHz.... think hard about coax at 144 MHz...... for the overachieving computer geek, antenna simulation software is readily available for cheap.... Start here http://www.eznec.com/  download the demo... play with the example antennas..... when you run out of space in the demo, send W7EL his money for the full program.... when you get good at antenna simulation complain that EZNEC is too limited.... spend BIG money on commercial simulator :-)..... 100 watts and a simple (well considered) antenna will do lots of HF radio for you... Life is too short for QRP, 100 watts on HF is good place to start, ham radio sucks if you make no contacts because nobody hears you... 1.5KW and a beam is better!.. QRP is the ham radio equivalent to fly fishing, expect to be hungry.... no matter how long you fool around with antennas you will never be satisfied, there's always a better one to build next week.... Talk to as many other hams as possible about antennas, don't believe most of what they say, use what they say to start your own investigation, make up your own mind about what's "right". Any group of 5 hams will have 7 different opinions about all subjects...... 73 / VRY GOOD DX OM DE WB7RSG	I think you're working process is correct for first version antennas	1

Mkay, my question comes with a story:In New Orleans 6 years ago, my wife and I walked into Harrah's and went to the roulette table. A running joke we have is that whenever my wife walks up to a table, the 6 comes up, and it's always too soon or too late for me to bet. So I plunked $20 on the 6 as my first bet, before the ball was in motion. There were 4 other players. I asked how the table was running, and they said it was a glacier. Of course, the next spin hit the 6. I will never forget the look on that croupier's face: He gave me a stone-cold look, checking to see if I'd somehow cheated.

on the brink	From up here, it looks less and less like the US is in decline, and more and more like it's on the brink of all-out collapse	I moved to Canada about 10 years ago... lucky enough to be a duel citizen. Part of it was politics; most of it was just for personal reasons--needing a change, getting away, etc... Just like you, i thought that if everyone left but the scumbags, it would just make things worse. I always assumed I'd move back after a few years.Now: My mom is moving up here tomorrow, because even with medicare, she can't *ever* afford to retire if she stays in the states, even though the cost of living is actually much higher up here, and she's already 67. She's Canadian, but she's lived in the US for the past 37 years, and is leaving all her friends and other family behind.More telling, my older brother, also duel, and a conservative christian, is moving up here in about 9 months. He's a born again, ex-Bush W. supporting republican, who got laid-off, worked on the Obama campaign, and now is bailing back to the homeland, too (he was 5 years old when we moved to the US... I was 0). He realized about a year ago that if he stayed in the US there is basically no hope for a future for either he or his family (he has a wife and 2 kids).  the US has moved way too far away from even his values, and voting Democrat doesn't help. It seems like even if there were only 9 Republicans in the House of Reps, and 1 in the Senate, they would still get everything they demanded... an end to environmental protections, security and care for those in mansions and gated communities, and shit-soup for everyone else.As for me, like I said, I'd always planned to go back to the US eventually, but, fuck it, I'm done. Every time I vote in Canada, even now after all these years, it's so refreshing to just mark an "X" in the circle by the name, and drop it into the box. No voting machines, no "hanging chads", no questions about registration (not registered? show up to the polls with an ID and a piece of mail with your address... that's it), no bullshit.

through the roof	Thats when I wake up in a jolt with my heart rate through the roof hoping I'm actually awake, not dreaming I'm awake	I've posted this tale before but its kind of relevant I'm not sure it counts:When I got injured as a kid I got put on morphine and I had a hallucination that I was pulled out the bed and dragged across the floor under a bed across the ward. It was beyond realistic, to the point i swear I could feel the cold floor scratching my hands as I tried to grab for something to stop me being dragged into the dark space under the other bed.Every now and then this comes back to me in sleep except its worse because I will dream I wake up and its dark but something is wrong so I'll try to get up but my legs will be all wobbly and I'll fall over and then whatever it is will grab my legs, its not so much hands but just pressure. I'll try and grab at the cold wall and feel my fingers bump across the gaps in my hard wood falls. The worst thing is I can never scream for some reason I can try really hard to scream but just feel like I'm choking.

jump to conclusions	These are generally the most productive immigrants in Canada, however the immigration system as a whole is a net benefit to Canada and one shouldn't jump to conclusions about any of the categories	I think you're mixing things up here. There's no '*economic refugee*' status, it's actually [economic immigration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Canada#Immigration_categories). These are generally the most productive immigrants in Canada, however the immigration system as a whole is a net benefit to Canada and one shouldn't jump to conclusions about any of the categories.Immigrants generally pay the same amount of taxes and receive the same amount of government services as Canadians who were born here ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_immigration_to_Canada#Government_finances)); and because we don't have a replacement birthrate, immigration is key to circumventing many demographic challenges that Canada will face in the near future.As for our refugee system, there are serious problems with those who would circumvent the intention of the system. However I think you'll find that if you observe the government's immigration policy over the last 5 years, it has vastly improved.

off the hook	gawwwd mom, I know!

You know, the usual, always use a condom yada yada yada. I was still relatively inexperienced (and a virgin) but my boyfriend and I had been spending a lot of time alone in the basement so mom was trying to be realistic of what was likely going on.Anyways, I rolled my eyes and was like... gawwwd mom, I know! She didn't let me off the hook so easy, and told me that while I might say that NOW, it gets harder to keep that in mind when things get "hot and heavy" (I will always remember that those were the exact words she used).I just figured she wasn't giving me enough credit, and that I would never lose myself during sex in an irresponsible manner.But now I understand.

again and again	This is the same conversation that comes up again and again	This is the same conversation that comes up again and again. As of yet, I don't see any serious contender to replace reddit. Metafilter is the closest, but for the discussion (which is the main reason I keep coming back to reddit), Metafilter's comment sorting system truly sucks. I'm done with reading threads with thousands of comments, unthreaded, and sorted strictly by time posted.When it comes to revising reddit, it seems like most people ignore the potential of the subreddits. As far as I know, no one has yet implemented a subreddit with the same feature that ensures better quality in MeFi submissions, *restricted access*.

on the same page	The odds of two people really being on the same page aren't all that great	I think being promiscuous is a bad thing. Sex has a nasty tendency of having a bunch of emotions tied to it. The odds of two people really being on the same page aren't all that great. So you're taking on the risk of one or two people getting hurt in the process of being vulnerable and open, and possibly hindering their ability to develop happy sexual relationships in the future. Do some people manage to have happy slutty lifestyles without hurting others? Well of course. Is it risky (in the sense of risking pregnancy, STDs and heartbreak)? Obviously. IMO in a macroeconomic sense the benefits don't outweigh the costs.	The odds of two people really having the same opinion isn't all that great	1

out of thin air	Whatever the encoding or compression, 10Mbps is 10Mbps; you're not going to create information out of thin air further down the line	On the contrary, I think the theoretical maximum bandwidths are fascinating from an engineering standpoint.

But if I had to reverse-engineer the HDMI standard, the very first thing I'd want to know is how fast and sensitive I'd need my oscilloscope to be.TLDR: It's not going to give you a lot of insight into anything else, but bandwidth is bandwidth, and saying "10 Mbps at most" is a lot more informative than just leaving it at "we don't use bytes".

rule of thumb	In general it's a good rule of thumb that if it comes right after a preposition, you should probably use "whom"	In general it's a good rule of thumb that if it comes right after a preposition, you should probably use "whom".   The problem in this case is that "To whoever started this . . . " isn't really a sentence.  You can see that "whoever started this" is a complete noun phrase, into which you can substitute "he" or "him" to see which one sounds right.  You're addressing your letter "to [noun phrase]".As BHSPitMonkey points out tho it really just boils down to whether the mystery person in question is a *subject* (the person *doing* something, in this case "starting this trend") or an *object* (the person that something *is being done to*, as in the letter appellation "to whom it may concern" where "it" is the subject which is doing the action of concerning).Anyway.  When in doubt, go with "who".  You'll get more flack for over-deploying "whom" than you will for under-deploying it.	In general you can assume that if it comes right after a preposition, you should probably use "whom"	1

draw a line in the sand	And I don't think Sabean is going to demand anything or draw a line in the sand for Bochy, so you kind of have to send him down	&gt; welcome to the world of **Bochy.**FTFY.I'm sorry, Bochy is a great manager, but I think his stubborn persistence in playing Huff is why this happened. It's similar to the "Oh, you won't play Posey? Fine, let me trade Molina," situation from last season, IMO.It's clear Bochy is not going to give Belt ABs, and it will do nothing for him to simply not play. And I don't think Sabean is going to demand anything or draw a line in the sand for Bochy, so you kind of have to send him down.That said, Belt is about to hit .300+ and drop bombs all over AAA pitching because he has *nothing left to prove in the minors.* He should be playing regularly in the MLB.

word of mouth	Dog walking and painting you should market by word of mouth (friends of friends, Facebook posts, etc	Good for you! Starting a business can be very rewarding.First you mentioned "the legality," which I guess means licensing. I wouldn't worry about a license for something like mowing a lawn or walking a dog or interior painting. Not at the scale you'll be starting at.Dog walking and painting you should market by word of mouth (friends of friends, Facebook posts, etc.) because these people would have to trust you in their homes. Lawn mowing could be offered by knocking door-to-door. "I'll mow your lawn right this minute for ten bucks" is a strong offer.To do those things on a larger scale or to do most any kind of construction, you'll want to be licensed. That could be a county matter or a state matter. Start by Googling your county and "business licensing."I find it easier to call government offices on the phone rather than hunt around for info on their websites. Just tell them in plain English the services that you want to provide to your customers. Government employees are usually nice to citizens in my experience.Then you mentioned "tax requirements." This amounts to:1) Tax payments and filing: IRS and your state department of revenue. Call em up. Download the forms, read and understand them. Do I need to file this form? Do I owe money? Am I going to comply? Know the law. Whether you follow it is up to you.2) Recordkeeping, which is a cornerstone of any good business owner. Always maintain the very best records you are able. Learn "double-entry bookkeeping."If this is useful to you and you have questions, I'm happy to help. Man, I did not intend to spend that long answering that question!

hard nut to crack	It may be a hard nut to crack though but when ever have an assumption of a non-physical parameter stood the test of added knowledge?	&gt;A collosotomy is performed to as a treatment for severe epilepsy.

That is not the issue at all. Suppose I'm deaf. It doesn't matter how much i know about your brain when you are hearing a violin, I will never know what one sounds like. The fact that there is something it feels like to be a human being, to touch, to see, to hear is what materialism cannot explain. How would you describe the taste of chicken to someone who has never tasted anything before. It's not that we cannot tell based on brain activity if your are eating chicken. We can do that. It's that we cannot tell what tasting is like. The major alternative is that first-person experience is an emergent phenomenon that is not reducible to the underlying neuronal activity.That we can't explain or decode the information, and different brains may use different decoding algorithms in does not say that neuronal activity is all that the signal comprise, That the signal may comprise additional parameters does not at all imply that they are non-physical.

brick and mortar	Try and develop a system where you can rival prices on online retailers than brick and mortar stores	So it seems to me that the digital age is coming and that physical inventory will be phasing out within the next few years. Have you considered downsizing your inventory to only a few copies of more recent popular games so your inventory cost would be minimal? Then you can offer customers free time to play/demo a game that you have and offer them a lower than MSRP price for a game which you can order for them via a catalog. I don't know if you have a wholesaler's licence to purchase games cheaply from manufacturers. Try and land a contract with a supplier so that you can order games as you need them rather than have a million copies of games like NBA 2k8 which virtually no one will ever buy.Also, see if you can get some wholesale deals or contracts with PC distributers or indie developers to sell their games in store for a discounted rate. Try and develop a system where you can rival prices on online retailers than brick and mortar stores. I figure in the gaming industry, the bulk of video games bought are via online and there are rarely ever any incentives for consumers to go out and buy it in store. Remember, you're catering to a consumer group who are "generally" well informed about their purchases.EDIT: I also though this would be an extremely worthy advice. Your main group of loyal costumers would probably fall around the college aged people. Try and do promo events on your local/nearby major university. Hold on campus tournaments where passer-bys can watch. Offer those who come into your both incentives to come to your store. Tell them about your business motto, which should offer something different than the typical Gamestop "we buy your games (for really cheap)" and "you can buy used (for really expensive)." Offer things like frequent buyer's and frequent tournament-goers cards. Build a local rep that rivals your local competition.

out of the blue	It's completely out of the blue and makes no sense	It's not arrogance. I literally never think about any other countries.

It's completely out of the blue and makes no sense. If we're arrogant, you guys are belligerent and rage-filled.America is really far away from most of you, and it's fucking ginormous. We have 300M people, 6x England's count, and we have absolutely no cause (or means by which, really) to ever to think "I wonder how they measure fluids in Caracas?" or "I wonder how tall I would be considered to be if I were in Belgium."You guys are *really* giving yourselves a lot of credit for how much you think we think about you. We don't. Ever. We're not using imperial *because* you're using metric. I bet most Americans haven't really even encountered metric and would be confused by your anger, and by the whole debate in the first place. It's nothing personal. We're just busy.

have a say	It's just about r/a, and I don't see why people who aren't part of r/a should have a say	&gt;This subreddit exists for the purpose of making r/anarchism a better place.

call a spade a spade	I think, in this instance, being unable to call a spade a spade does more harm than good to the pro-cannabis movement	I get what he means, but I still disagree with that mindset.If we want anyone to take Cannabis seriously, as a plant with legitimate medical use, we need to be open about it actually BEING a drug that affects the normal functions of the body. It helps tremendously with my arthritis, and my wife has been using it for years to deal with her PMS. I have seen people have everything from freakouts to anxiety attacks to  huge personal epiphanies under its influence. I think, in this instance, being unable to call a spade a spade does more harm than good to the pro-cannabis movement.And the harvesting, trimming, drying and curing of weed is a fairly long process that can take 2-3 weeks.

all over the place	There's two creeks, river access, and a bunch of pathways all over the place	If you like being in the woods, check out Rush Run Park. It's across the Olentangy river from Antrim. I rarely see anyone there, and when I do, they are just talking a walk. It's in Riverlea. You can get to it from the north side of the apartment complex at the end of Broadmeadows Blvd or you can park at the south side of Olentangy Blvd. I prefer the latter. There's two creeks, river access, and a bunch of pathways all over the place. I don't think too many people know about it. Besides the highway noise it doesn't feel like any other park in the city that I've found.	There's two creeks, river access, and a bunch of pathways everywhere	1

down the road	20 years down the road, Russia is still struggling with the after math of what he did	Yelstins "Democracy" privatized the country at such a rate, where those in political power took all the wealth and left everyone else with nothing. In fact, this "Democracy" turned into anarchy, where business rivals would murder each other and ship government money off to Swiss banks. 20 years down the road, Russia is still struggling with the after math of what he did.That said, Russia needed serious change into democracy and a free market economy. The Soviet Union lived its age and could no longer  maintain itself. The problem is that it happened overnight and a new "Democratic" government was created no better than that of the Soviet Union. Russia is still fighting corruptions in every sector of government and business. Billions of stolen in tax and government money are shipped out every year. The same party has ruled for 20 years and will rule under some different name when times get tough. This is not a democracy and is not what everyone wanted.Russia is still living in the dark ages of foreign relations just like the Soviet Union was. No trust for anyone. As  Russian citizen studying in the US, I can't get more than a 1 year visa. This isn't the fault of the US, because every time I come to the consulate they tell me "its unfortunate you have to reapply every year, but your country refuses to give our citizens more than a year". As a Russian citizen, I have to suffer the backwardness of my own nation.	20 years in the future, Russia is still struggling with the after math of what he did	1

In fact, this "Democracy" turned into anarchy, where business rivals would murder each other and ship government money off to Swiss banks. 20 years down the road, Russia is still struggling with the after math of what he did.That said, Russia needed serious change into democracy and a free market economy. The Soviet Union lived its age and could no longer  maintain itself. The problem is that it happened overnight and a new "Democratic" government was created no better than that of the Soviet Union. Russia is still fighting corruptions in every sector of government and business. Billions of stolen in tax and government money are shipped out every year. The same party has ruled for 20 years and will rule under some different name when times get tough. This is not a democracy and is not what everyone wanted.Russia is still living in the dark ages of foreign relations just like the Soviet Union was. No trust for anyone. As  Russian citizen studying in the US, I can't get more than a 1 year visa. This isn't the fault of the US, because every time I come to the consulate they tell me "its unfortunate you have to reapply every year, but your country refuses to give our citizens more than a year".

all that jazz	So Dayne was definitely a great swordsman, and he had a reputation as being an impeccable *true* knight (honourable and loyal and all that jazz), and he also had an awesome sword	I knew most people would vote for Arthur Dayne this round.But I think a lot of people are confusing being a great *"knight"* with being a great *"swordsman"*. They are not necessarily the same thing.Being a truly great *"Knight"* involves honour, chivalry, loyalty, and all that fancy "Knight of the Round Table" stuff.In that regard Ser Arthur Dayne had an *impecable* reputation and was considered to be one of the greatest knights ever known in the seven kingdoms. But with regards to his skill as a great *"swordsman"* things are not nearly so perfect.1. Rhaegar defeated Dayne in several tournaments.2. Jaime Lanister (one of Dayne's students) also defeated Dayne in a few tournaments.3. Dayne was eventually killed in combat in a small skirmish where he was outnumbered by Ned Stark and his men by 3 to 1. Ned Stark and Howland Reed survived and everyone else died. So Dayne was definitely a great swordsman, and he had a reputation as being an impeccable *true* knight (honourable and loyal and all that jazz), and he also had an awesome sword....but he was not unbeatable.

on thin ice	I'm not ready to grab my pitchfork just yet, but they're on thin ice	Coming up with new and fun spell combinations (as well as silly ones) was one of main things that made replaying Morrowind and Oblivion fun. Without custom spells, what else is there to do once the story's been played out?  You're not going to be able to force players that do things like squeezing every ounce of power from spell, to suddenly play completely organically.  They'll either use mods, or find something else to obsess over. They will make the entire game a spreadsheet if they want to. So why are you punishing us for what some other players might do, keeping in mind they'll still do it anyway?Also, what about people who like to roleplay their mage? If I wanted to play a pyromancer on Oblivion, I had to custom-make almost every single spell because the ones the game provided sucked. What then, without spellmaking?

have a go	EDIT: lol not trying to have a go at you or anything	plus I really just wanted to use a condom half the time. Feeling more secure about birth control means I can focus more on the act anyway. Less pressure more fun. If it really honestly feels so good you can't live without it girls then FFS get an IUD or go on the pill.EDIT: lol not trying to have a go at you or anything. At least you keep track of your ovulation cycle. A certain someone else never did lol	EDIT: lol not trying to make a pass or anything	1

on the same page	:)If you're not talking about that, then please explain it to me, I'd like to get on the same page	I'm not sure what you mean. If you're referring to my physical deal breakers, I'm specifically meaning extreme cases. For example, wearing gross pajamas out in public, not taking showers or brushing teeth unless being told to, not wearing pants when you have guests over, etc. When you have to explain why this isn't cool to a boyfriend, you start to feel like their mother, and I appreciate maturity. :)If you're not talking about that, then please explain it to me, I'd like to get on the same page. :)	:)If you're not talking about that, then please explain it to me, I'd like to agree	1

loud and clear	I have a very difficult time keeping up with spoken conversations, am very distracted by background noise, and can virtually never understand people - no matter how loud and clear they are- when there is music, cars, etc in the environment	I'll try to cover everything you've mentioned. First, with regards to the difficulty communicating with speech: Apraxia is definitely a player in it. I can know exactly what I would mean to say, but not be able to think of the right words, or push them into the right mouth shapes, and actually articulate them. I might um a lot or repeat the same word over and over until I can think of something else to say. The other end of the issue is, of course, that speech is scary and drains a lot of my "social reserve". I can do less than I otherwise can when I'm pouring all my energy into "talking right".I sound a lot less intelligent than I am when I try to speak, and that's even granting that my speech has naturally improved considerably over the last few years. This, in turn, makes people treat me like I'm less intelligent than I am and makes me want to socialize less. I've used a lot of high-tech AAC devices in my day. A lot of the interfaces, including my pathfinder's interface, are so helplessly confusing that my word choice becomes far more limited than it is in front of a keyboard.  As a personal preference, one shared by many autistic people who are reasonably expressive in writing, I think laptop or tablet based AAC is a better first thing to try, especially with older children or adults. There's just so many -more- ways to express with a full computer than a dumbed-down device with non-natural (to us) language rules. I do think that AAC can be kind of useless if the family is combative against it, but I also think that some effort needs to be put into changing that viewpoint. Being able to express wants and needs verbally is good, being able to express complex thoughts, experiences, and feelings via speech, text, sign, pictures- whatever works for you- is also incredibly important. I am not merely a person who wants breakfast right now and needs to visit the toilet, but that's what not having access to a laptop would reduce me to. I wonder what you mean by not targeting phonological skills. I would think that as an SLP, that would be a significant part of your practice? With regards to literacy skills, I do think some emphasis should be placed either by you (or by someone else in the child's team) in finding out what they are, what barriers exist for the child, and attempting to improve the situation. Many of us who are completely useless talkers but good writers were hyperlexic kids. Most nonverbal or less verbal autistic adults I know use a laptop, sign language, or both. The ones I know who use a dedicated AAC device don't use it as their sole form of communication. I'd say that anyone who shows signs of being able to read (or express with picture-based systems, which you can use with a laptop) and has speech difficulties might potentially benefit from the high-tech but low-specialization using a computer offers.I have a very difficult time keeping up with spoken conversations, am very distracted by background noise, and can virtually never understand people - no matter how loud and clear they are- when there is music, cars, etc in the environment. I use closed captions on my TV and prefer one-on-one communication in quieter places for this reason. A notable exception, one I'm not the only autistic person to express, is that I like and understand my speech synthesizer's voice quite well at considerable speeds. Perhaps this is because I've spent years listening to it. Perhaps this is because I listen to it through headphones, which reduce background noise and increase clarity. Perhaps this is because it does not have the nuances that human speech has- it doesn't change tone or pitch in ways I haven't told it to, it maintains a consistent speed, so on. On the other hand, as you can see, I can understand written words pretty well. I still have trouble with sarcasm, emotions, metaphors, etc in text but the issue is not nearly as apparent or as negative to my ability to communicate as it is in spoken language. You're welcome. Feel free to add any questions or ask for clarification.
