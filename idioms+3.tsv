wouldn't you know it
wrap one's head around
wriggle out of
write home about
writing on the wall
wrong place at the wrong time
wrong side of the tracks
year in, year out
yellow brick road
yes and no
you don't say
you know it
you know what
you name it
you shouldn't have
you're telling me
young at heart
zero in on
