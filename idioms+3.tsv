weight of the world
well and good
well and truly
well, I never
wet behind the ears
wet one's pants
wet the bed
what are the odds
what can I say
what do I know
what do you say
what else is new
what is more
what it takes
what someone said
what was that
what you see is what you get
what's going on
what's in it for me
what's the difference
what's the matter
whatever it takes
when all is said and done
when push comes to shove
when the chips are down
where it's at
whys and wherefores
wide of the mark
win the day
wind at one's back
wipe the slate clean
with a grain of salt
with a vengeance
with a view to
with all due respect
with an eye to
with an eye towards
with any luck
with bated breath
with both hands
with flying colors
with one's bare hands
with one's head held high
with open arms
with the manner
within living memory
without a hitch
without further ado
wolf in sheep's clothing
word of mouth
word on the street
word to the wise
work one's butt off
work one's magic
work to rule
worse for wear
worst of both worlds
worth every penny
worth its weight in gold
worth one's salt
worth one's while
wouldn't hurt a fly
wouldn't you know
wouldn't you know it
wrap one's head around
wriggle out of
write home about
writing on the wall
wrong place at the wrong time
wrong side of the tracks
year in, year out
yellow brick road
yes and no
you don't say
you know it
you know what
you name it
you shouldn't have
you're telling me
young at heart
zero in on
